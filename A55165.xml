            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95381:6"/>
which was to attend a <hi>Conſult</hi> there hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the <hi>Great Biſhop</hi> and his <hi>Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> about carrying on their Deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Albonia:</hi> Their arrival at the place of the <hi>Conſult:</hi> A deſcription of the place: The Author placed on <hi>Phileroy</hi>'s Apartment, where <hi>incognito,</hi> he takes his Obſervations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEing naturally delighted in reading of Forein Peregrinations and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the different Manners and Cuſtoms of ſtrange Countries, I was one night mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon ſuch Subjects, till ſleep (the Ape of Reaſon) had diſpoſſeſt me of my conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering faculty, and turn'd it wholly into Imagination and Fancy; by the force of which on the ſudden I was carried into the Hyſperian Countries, where having ſtaid a ſmall time to remarque ſome moſt noted Obſervables of that <hi>Catholick Region</hi> (me-thoughts) I approacht towards the Sea-coaſt, and finding a Veſſel ready, did (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving agreed for hire) therein imbarque my ſelf for <hi>Italy,</hi> the principal of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> Countries, and thence to return again to <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> having paſt the <hi>Fretum Gaditanum,</hi> and entred into the <hi>Levant,</hi> we were by force of Winds
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95381:6"/>
carried to the utmoſt parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the burning Iſlands; the chiefeſt of which is <hi>Strombolo,</hi> commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> of thoſe Countries to be the Jaws of <hi>Hell,</hi> and that therein the damned ſouls are tormented; here, notwithſtanding the frightfulneſs of ſuch Reports, we were forced to put in for a Refuge againſt the Storm; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving landed our ſelves at the foot of that burning Mountain, I and ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had a mind to aſcend it, to ſee the curioſities of that feigned <hi>Incendium.</hi> We had by leiſurely and winding Aſcents ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to near three parts of the way, when in a ſolitary by-way amongſt a queach of buſhes, we diſcovered ſomething in the ſhape of a black man, ſoftly moving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; I and my company were, I muſt confeſs, ſomewhat ſtartled and ſurprized to ſee any thing like humane in that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and uninhabited Region, and therefore concluded it muſt be ſome <hi>Devil</hi> or other that was ſent out as a Scout to ſurprize ſuch unwary paſſengers as our ſelves; or elſe ſome poor Purgatory Soul (that by the power of Maſſes) had got leave to cool himſelf in the open Air: My Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were at the point of turning back again
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95381:7"/>
in a fright, but I perſuaded them againſt it, telling them, if it were the Devil, it were more ſafe to reſiſt him, than to fly; whereupon they all beſides my ſelf being <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> began to croſs themſelves a main, to rattle their Beads, and to mutter over their <hi>Ave Maries</hi> at ſuch a rate, that for my part, though I could not forbear ſmiling at their folly, yet I was more afraid of ſuch their ridiculous incantations, than of the ſuppoſed Devil: The beſt on't was, all this while his back was towards us, and his poſture rather ſtanding than progreſſive, taking his ſteps ſo leiſurely, as if ſome weighty notions in his head had retarded the motion of his heels: By this means we hop'd to avoid his ſight of us, and proceeded forward, when on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den we heard him (who had hitherto kept ſilence) break out into theſe expreſſions, which he utter'd with ſomewhat a low, but earneſt voice, and plain enough to be heard [Oh <hi>Albonia, Albonia,</hi> Dear <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonia,</hi> What will become of thee?] The Company heard the words as well as I, out underſtood them not, being ſpoke in the <hi>Albonian</hi> Language, which being my own native Dialect, made me wonder much more, and to be more attentive to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95381:7"/>
what follow'd, which after a ſhort pauſe was this; [Here's a <hi>Plot</hi> indeed with <hi>Hell</hi> and deſtruction at the beginning and end on't—Now the <hi>Devil</hi> take the <hi>Plot,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> take Devil, Plot, Plotters, and all, I'le get rid of them as ſoon as with ſafety I can, and diſcover, and then let their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilſhips</hi> do their worſt, I will put my ſelf under the protection of the <hi>Albonian Prince,</hi> &amp; defie their malice; and as I have now opportunity to know, I ſhall be then as well able to countermine their deſigns. Theſe expreſſions I heard and underſtood, but were as myſterious to me as a <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian Oracle:</hi> My Company were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd too, to hear what they underſtood not; and imagining by my attention, and ſome alterations they diſcerned in my looks, that I might underſtand the <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> they deſired me for once to be ſo kind to them, as to be <hi>Interpreter</hi> for the <hi>Devil;</hi> but I excuſed my ſelf with a <hi>Pardonne moy Meſſieurs;</hi> I told them I had not been bred up long enough in the Infernal Countries, to underſtand any more of their <hi>Lingua</hi> than themſelves—The truth is, hearing talk of <hi>Plots,</hi> and my own dear Native Country of <hi>Albonia</hi> named, I was unwilling (till I could be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

informed) to diſcover any thing to them, that I knew as they were <hi>Petropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,</hi> were Enemies to us. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with the muttering noiſe we made, the <hi>Apparition</hi> turned about, and look'd at us: I confeſs when I ſaw him move, I was afraid I ſhould have ſeen the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Countenance, that like <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head, ſhould have turn'd us all into Stone, or Changelings; but ſeeing him look with an humane Form and Viſage, I took heart of grace, and ſtood my ground till he came nearer to us; but then ſtanding ſtill, and looking ſtedfaſtly and grimly upon us, he ſpake to us in the <hi>Hyſperian</hi> Language, which my Company then underſtood thus: Sirs, What are you? Whence come you? What make you here in the <hi>Luciferian</hi> Territories, which is ground not for <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> to tread upon—Theſe words were Thunderbolts to our Company, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other reply, fell to croſſing and bleſſing themſelves as before, expecting nothing but preſently to be devoured—or to have their Souls ſhaken out of their Bodies, and carried directly to <hi>Limbus</hi>— But his next words were yet more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when he told them, That he was <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> to the Infernal <hi>Lord</hi> of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95381:8"/>
and that his office was to ſeize upon all Waiſs and Strays that he found there as forfeits to the Lord of the Soil, that finding us ſuch, his commiſſion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to uncaſe us of our Bodies, and to faggot up our Souls together, and carry them to <hi>Limbus.</hi> Dreadfully did theſe words ſound in the Ears of the poor tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> who needed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſanimation than their own fears, who thus hearing their doom, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way to avoid it, did pitifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt one boon only of the <hi>Apparition</hi> before their ſeizure, That he would give them leave to return back to their Veſſel, that brought them thither to ſend away Letters to their friends to ſay <hi>Maſſes</hi> and <hi>Dirges</hi> for them (when in <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>) for their releaſment. This their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, urged with their pitiful looks and behaviour, was at laſt granted upon their ſolemn <hi>Paroll</hi> given of returning back to the ſame place, as ſoon as they had ſent away their diſpatches; and leaving one of the Company in <hi>hoſtage</hi> for the return of the reſt, and for this we were to caſt lots, which we did; and the Lot fell upon me— The truth is, I had no ſuch pretence to make for my ſelf as they had, and joyned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95381:9"/>
not with them in theirs: I had ſecurity of better means to preſerve my ſelf againſt the Infernal Powers, than Maſſes and ſuch fopperies: Neither indeed did I much dread them, having a ſtrong perſuaſion grounded upon reaſons beſt known to my ſelf, that this whole Scene which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them ſo <hi>Tragical,</hi> was no other than meer <hi>Figment</hi> and deluſion. Well, thus I was left, and my Companions having received their <hi>Manumiſſion,</hi> turned down the Hill ſwifter than they intended to return, which indeed they never did, as the <hi>Apparition</hi> upon our after-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance told me pleaſantly he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not they ſhould; notwithſtanding they had pawn'd their Words and Oaths to boot for it; for he told me their Religion was ſuch, that they could eaſily diſpenſe with ſuch things; and as they ſtick not to break their words with Hereticks, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they keep it with the Devil himſelf, except it were to ſerve him on their own deſigns—<hi>Timor addidit alas,</hi> the ſource of a Torrent from the fall of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice was not more ſwift than their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their retreat, <hi>they</hi> ran as if the <hi>Devil</hi> (indeed) had drove them. After they were gone, and I left alone with my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95381:9"/>
                  <hi>Guardiane</hi>—I perceived his Eyes ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly fixt upon me, but knew not the meaning of it, till he reſolved me by the kindneſs of an affectionate Embrace, and calling me by the term of his dear Friend and Countryman <hi>Philopatris,</hi> and at the ſame time upon more ſtrict obſervance of his voice and features, I knew I was in the Arms of my old Friend <hi>Phileroy</hi>— I was glad, you may conceive, to find an old Friend in a New Soil, which (upon his requeſt) I informed him how I came to Land upon, with a ſhort Hiſtory of my Adventures in the Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but being eſpecially deſirous to know how things ſtood in <hi>Albonia,</hi> I ſatisfied him that I left all things well, that we enjoyed the benefit which our Neighbours round about us were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of, of a ſecure and happy Peace— <hi>God</hi> grant it be ſo, quoth he, and that it may continue. But I fear it will be too ſoon diſturbed by that Curſed <hi>Plot</hi> that is now hatching againſt them—Hearing again the name of a <hi>Plot,</hi> I could not be much diſturbed in my mind, till I underſtood what he meant by it. I knew <hi>Phileroy</hi> of old to be no Flaſh, or one that would ſpeak things unadviſedly, or at Random, and therefore deſired him at once to heal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95381:10"/>
my fears and curioſity, by explaining his meaning—But what, quoth <hi>Phileroy,</hi> Is indeed the name of a <hi>Plot</hi> ſo ſtrange a thing to you, that you ſeemed ſo ſurprized at the hearing of it? Heard you no rumors of it in <hi>Albonia</hi> before you left it? Not a word, quoth I—nor any ſuſpicion or jealouſies, replied he, of a Party there lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon deſign to take off the <hi>Prince,</hi> and ſubvert the Government? <q>
                     <hi>Forbid it Heavens,</hi> quoth I again, (then in a great paſſion) That our Dear <hi>Albonia</hi> ſhould harbour any ſuch Vipers in her Bowels. You know full well, Dear <hi>Phileroy,</hi> how well we are ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any fears of ſuch Attempts by the graciouſneſs of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and happy Conſtitution of the Government we live under: It is Tyranny and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that firſt raiſes diſcontents, and then puts factious ſpirits upon deſigns of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;</hi> but as there are no ſuch grounds amongſt us to provoke to ſuch deſigns, ſo we the leſs fear any to attempt, except the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf ſhould raiſe any Curſed-Inſtruments that out of meer Envy to our happineſs, ſhould go about to deſtroy it. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch Inteſtine Monſters lurking amongſt our ſelves, that ſhould go about
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95381:10"/>
to diſturb that bleſſed Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity we enjoy, were to conclude men Enemies to their own good, as well as their Country's, in whoſe welfare they are joynt-ſharers. You know we are an United <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom</hi> under a <hi>Chriſtian Prince,</hi> whoſe prerogative it is to be <hi>Scutum Fidei</hi> both to us and the Chriſtian World: And though it be our unhappineſs to have ſome Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that out of reſpect of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do diſſent from others in ſome leſſer matters, relating to Modes and Ceremonies of Worſhip, yet as the Principles of that <hi>Religion</hi> (wherein we are all united) does bind them; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the clemency and moderation of our <hi>Prince</hi> has farther obliged them to their duty and obedience by thoſe in-indulgencies which he has graciouſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them againſt the ſeverities of the Laws againſt them. And though contrary to the <hi>Princes</hi> inclination, ſome ill men have gone about malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to exaſperate ſome of them by forcing the Edge of thoſe Laws againſt them; yet the Experience of now above twenty years, has confirmed us, that there hath no ſuch <hi>Plots</hi> or Attempts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95381:11"/>
on their parts been attempted. And this <hi>Phileroy</hi> is ſo well known to you, that I may ſuppoſe theſe are not the Parties you mean for the Plotters</q>—No, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Phileroy,</hi> yet thoſe perſons that are the real Plotters, have laid their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſo, as to endeavour to repreſent them ſuch, and ſo to <hi>Sham</hi> it off themſelves— But ſeeing we are ſo happily met in a ſtrange place, and have opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe things ſo material to the welfare of our ſelves and Country; let us quit our Station, and walk on; for I know you have a curioſity of ſeeing that place, which your timorous Companions are ſo glad they are freed from. I will diſcourſe theſe things more fully to you by the way, and withal the reaſon of my coming hither, and ſtay here; with all my heart, cryed I— So we proceeded, he leading the way through ſolitary by paths, ſtill leiſurely aſcending. We had not gone far, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into any farther talk before we were attacqued with the noiſe of a great ſhout from the top of the <hi>Flaming Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and after that a roaring kind of noiſe, like the bellowings of a Bull; at which I ſtartled, being frightfully poſſeſt with an apprehenſion that I ſhould be put
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95381:11"/>
to encounter with <hi>Monſters</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi> if I proceeded farther. I expected indeed that my Friend <hi>Phileroy</hi> (that I knew was neither Witch nor Conjurer) ſhould be ſcared as well as I—but inſtead thereof I was ſurpriz'd to ſee him fall into a loud fit of Laughter, asking me pleaſantly what was the matter? The matter (quoth I) Are you ſo danger-proof to make a jeſt of theſe things? Heard you not the ſhouts and hollowings juſt now over our heads, together with the bellowings of a <hi>Bull:</hi> For my part I am apt to think now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that I am in the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Country, and that ſome of his Scouts, having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our Arrival, are gone to inform the Garriſon of it, to come and ſeize us: Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage man (replyed <hi>Phileroy</hi> ſtill laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I thought you, being a Chriſtian, had been <hi>Devil-proof,</hi> tho your Companions, the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> were not; you are more afraid than hurt, I will aſſure you: And to evidence this to you, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to releaſe you from your frights and aſtoniſhments by this ſhort Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, wherein (to prevent farther que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions) I will <hi>firſt</hi> acquaint you with the Cauſe of my coming hither; you know, when I left <hi>Albonia</hi> about two years
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95381:12"/>
ſince I deſigned to travel into the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Countries, not to learn their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to obſerve their Manners, and to ſatisfie my curioſity concerning their Policies, and thoſe things which are ſo commonly reported of them in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Having with little ſtay poſted over the Adjacent Countries, I came to <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> it ſelf, the place where I intended to make my Reſidence; there the <hi>Arch-Flammin,</hi> or <hi>Great Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans</hi> keeps his Court; I had a great deſire to inform my ſelf of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of it, and of thoſe grand Affairs that were there managed relating to the <hi>Petropolitan-Weal,</hi> by the <hi>Grand-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and his <hi>Scarlet Senate.</hi> But this being a thing difficult, you know, for a Chriſtian to enterprize amongſt profeſſed Enemies, I had learned ſo much of their Arts, as to conceal my Religion, and to profeſs my ſelf one of theirs conforming my ſelf in all places to the ſame Modes and Cuſtoms as they did; and by this ſtratagem inſinuated my ſelf ſo far into the good Opinion, not only of the People, but the Prieſts themſelves, that at laſt I was perſuaded by them to take upon me a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Habit; then I thought my ſelf a fine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95381:12"/>
fool indeed; but having ſo got a cloak for my knavery, I thought I ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have the better opportunity to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theirs, and ſo indeed it happily fell out; for by this means being lookt upon as a Brother of the <hi>Petropolitan-Tribe.</hi> I had the more freedom to be preſent at their <hi>Conſults</hi> and Meetings, which I quickly underſtood to be then managed principally againſt Our Dear Country of <hi>Albonia.</hi> Nor (although I was well known by them to be a Native of that place) were they any wiſe jealous of my company, or debarr'd the freedom of theirs, looking upon <hi>Renegades,</hi> (ſuch as they took me to be) to be moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Deſigns and Intereſts.</p>
               <p>They had now by the influence of their <hi>great Biſhop</hi> fully reſolved upon the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of our <hi>Hilbonian State,</hi> whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in our Religion, and that civil peace we enjoyed, had been ſuch a continual eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore to them; And to accompliſh this the better, <hi>Lucifer</hi> their old Friend is to find them with fit Inſtruments, to carry on their treacherous Deſigns, ſuch as ſhall not ſtick or boggle at the greateſt Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the ſubverſion of our ancient <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> the deſtruction of our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95381:13"/>
Towns and Cities, the maſſacreing of their Inhabitants, and (which is more than all and the moſt likely means for them to make a full Conqueſt of us) the aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our dear <hi>Prince,</hi> in the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whoſe ſacred Life conſiſt the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our own Lives, Liberties and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This is the work they had cut out for their helliſh. Inſtruments to diſpatch for them—Here I interrupted him having heard him thus far with the greateſt terror and amazement imaginable— But what quoth I, if they ſhould ſucceed (which God in mercy prevent) to take away the life of our gracious Prince, what would they be the nearer, when the next imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> ſhall by his Authority at once Revenge their Treaſons paſt, and prevent their Deſigns to come againſt us— That's true indeed, replied <hi>Phileroy,</hi> could we be ſecure of a <hi>Chriſtian Prince</hi> to ſucceed in the Government; but to prevent that, they have by their wicked Agents already made ſure of him, that is <hi>preſumptively</hi> to ſucceed, by ſeducing him from the Religion of his Country, to the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Faith, whoſe future Authority thereby ſo neceſſarily obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to their Intereſts, inſtead of being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95381:13"/>
a Terror, is become their greateſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in their Proceedings. This they look upon as their Maſterpiece and very ground-work of their Conſpiracy: And having gained this great point by ſecuring one that ſhall be true to their Intereſt, their next work is to make way for him by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the life of our preſent <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> to carry on which curſed deſign (as the <hi>Devil</hi> has helped them with Agents enough, and fit enough for their purpoſe) ſo now they are at this time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in deep Conſults, how to manage them in their Attempts of it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would (in a matter of ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy and importance) be the more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in their Conſultations. The <hi>great Biſhop</hi> and his Counſel, and Agents have choſen this place as moſt fit for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where they have been retired for ſome daies in the ſooty apartments of the <hi>Luciferian</hi> pallace, which is the place I ſhall preſently diſcover to you; it lies at the very mouth of the ſulphureous Gulph, underneath which, they ſay, is the place of <hi>Purgatory:</hi> The <hi>great Biſhop</hi> holds himſelf by vertue of his <hi>Keyes Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of this fiery Garriſon, and has thence ariſing a very great Revennue for ſees of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95381:14"/>
releaſing tormented Priſoners out of it; and this they rather choſe for the place of their Caball, that they might have their great Friend and Oracle <hi>Don Lucifero</hi> preſent at their Conſultations; I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them hither, not out of any great deſire I had to give the <hi>Devil</hi> a Viſit, but to obſerve the Progreſs of their Deſigns; upon which they have been now theſe 3 daies in cloſe Conſultation; This morning being quite, quite wearied and almoſt ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with heats and clamour, I ſtole away from my Company to recruit my Spirits with a little freſh air, and taking the next ſolitary path I met with, I walked on mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon theſe matters, and contriving with my ſelf, how I might make means to prevent their Proceedings by a timely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, which I reſolved to do, as ſoon as poſſibly I could with any ſafety to my ſelf, get looſe from them. In the midſt of theſe cogitations it was, that you found me in that ſolitary place and poſture; and glad was I ſo happily to meet one with whom I can with freedom diſcourſe of thoſe things, that have been ſo long bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom to my thoughts—And now dear <hi>Philopatris</hi> having given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the occaſion of my ſtay here, you
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95381:14"/>
ſhall bear me company back to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,</hi> where you ſhall your ſelf be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what is acted amongſt them. And this you may do without fear or hazard, being in my company, and pretending your ſelf to be a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> and one of my Friends and acquaintance, you ſhall fare no worſe than I do, and have as good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as <hi>Purgatory</hi> can afford, I will aſſure you; I thank you for your kindneſs replied I, (ſmiling at the conceit of it;) No queſtion but the entertainment muſt be extraordinary where the <hi>Devil</hi> is the <hi>Hoſt</hi> and his <hi>Imps</hi> the <hi>Servitours;</hi> but if we come to Table with him, I hope we ſhall have long Spoons to eat our broth with; I know not (quoth <hi>Phileroy</hi>) what length your Spoons are of; but I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your Commons ſhall be ſhort e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough—diſcourſing thus together, we were come almoſt to the pitch of the Hill. When we were alarum'd with another great Shout like that before. I asked my friend if he knew what it meant; he told me, he ſuppoſed it was occaſioned by a <hi>Bull</hi> which they had deſigned to ſend over into <hi>Albonia,</hi> and were that morning preparing him for the voyage, with Swords, Piſtols and Fire-bolts faſtned about him (like the Bulls
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95381:15"/>
in the <hi>Bear-garden</hi> harneſſed with Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Serpents) which were deſigned for ſome diſmal Execution; I hope ſaid I when he comes there, he will be baited to ſome purpoſe: No doubt on't replied <hi>Phileroy,</hi> and I hope my ſelf ere long to be one of thoſe that ſhall worrie him—He is to roar out Excommunication againſt the Prince, and Threatnings (of no leſs than damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) againſt ſuch Subjects as ſhall dare to Obey him contrary to the great Biſhop's Pleaſure; but as curſt Cows are ſaid to have ſhort Horns, ſo have their Bulls too, too ſhort to do miſchief, let them make what noiſe they will; Our Chriſtian <hi>Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> neither value nor fear them— But Whiſt— no more of this, leſt we hap to be diſcovered by ſome of the Centries that are poſted up and down about this place—See yonder's one ſtands ready to examine us— and with lifting up mine eyes (upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brow of the Hill) I ſaw an ugly, black, Grim-look'd Fellow, with a Muſquet on his Shoulder, and Match in his Hand, who, upon our nearer approach towards him, cried out, <hi>Stand</hi>—Who are you— Friends, replied <hi>Phileroy,</hi> (and with that privately ſhuffled a Roſary of Beads with a Crucifix into my hand, which he bid me put
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95381:15"/>
in my Pocket) We are Friends I tell ye; But how ſhall I know that (ſaies the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Officer</hi>) I know you <hi>(Phileroy)</hi> well enough; but who is the other with you—An <hi>Honeſt Fellow,</hi> replies my Friend, I will engage for him—An honeſt Fellow, ſaies the Centry—What ſhould he do here, you know this is no place for ſuch Perſons—What have we to do with Honeſty- he looks like an <hi>Heretick,</hi> be he what he will, I will have him before the <hi>Inquiſition</hi>— Soft Friend, quoth <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy,</hi> you are miſtaken in the man, I tell you he is a Friend and a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> which he ſhall make appear to you by his Certificate, and with that he whiſpered me in the Ear to produce the Beads to him, which I did, and thereupon he let us paſs— I was afraid by this paſſage (as I told <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi>) that Honeſty being ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd in that place, I ſhould by ſome looks or geſtures pretending to it, betray my ſelf to their Suſpicion, and ſo incur their Cenſures—But for that he told me, I muſt learn to diſſemble as well as he, when I came amongſt them; to lay off my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Serenity, and to aſſume a diſtorted, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and troubled Viſage—This I thought I might eaſily be forced to do, when I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95381:16"/>
came amongſt ſuch a company: The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of which, methoughts had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready altered my very form and I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned not (as I told him) but if I ſtayed any time with them, I ſhould be ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd by their Society, as to look as ugly as themſelves. One Caution more he gave me, that I ſhould have my <hi>Roſarie</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in ſight, either in my hand, or at my Girdle, as a badge of the Religion; but becauſe I did not much care to handle ſuch Sorceries, I choſe to have them hung dangling at my Girdle—And thus on the ſudden I was turned <hi>Friar</hi> in <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade</hi>— And wiſhing my ſelf good luck in the Adventure we proceeded till we came to the very gates of <hi>Limbus.</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror itſelf cannot expreſs the diſmalneſs of that place, it is ſeated in the midſt of a little <hi>Plain,</hi> about a furlong over on the higheſt top of the <hi>Burning Mountain,</hi> the flames of which in ſeveral places from the Caverns and Hollows of the Earth, (cauſed by their irruptions) brake forth in an hiddeous manner, and darkned the Sky with mighty Clouds of ſulphureous Smoak and Vapour ariſing from them: The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the <hi>Infernal Pallace</hi> lies through a hollow Way deſcending from the ſurface
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95381:16"/>
ſome few paces to a great pair of Gates that gives Entrance to it; here we arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my friend <hi>Phileroy</hi> knocked at the Wicket: But it ſeems they were very cloſe at their buſineſs; for we ſtood a conſiderable time before we could gain Admittance— At laſt one of them came and opened the door, holding it in his hand, till he had taken a full view of us; and ſeeing (by the glimmering of a Lamp that was ſet over the door for ſuch purpoſes) who it was, <hi>Phileroy</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently admitted, who taking me by the hand, endeavoured to pull me in after him; but the ſuſpicious <hi>Feind</hi> would not ſuffer that, till I was fain to ſhew him the baubles at my Girdle; and that <hi>Phileroy</hi> had aſſured him that I was a friend of his, and a <hi>Petropolitan;</hi> then I was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and taking faſt hold of <hi>Phileroy,</hi> ſtumbled along through a blind Entry, ſo rough and declining withal, that I think if it had not been for <hi>Phileroy,</hi> I had broke my Neck before I had come to the end of it; but he being better acquainted with the paſſage, bore me up ſteady, till he brought me through it into a very large Room, as big for its dimenſions as the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Petropolis;</hi> the place
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95381:17"/>
was ſultry hot, as a Dutch Stove, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much hotter, inſomuch as I was fain preſently to rip ope my dublet, and fall a breathing like a Fiſh out of water, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſtifled forthwith, if I could not get in ſome mouth-fulls of Air into my gaſping Jaws to relieve me; and yet that very Air I did ſuck in, was ſo ſultry and ſcalding, as made my very lungs to boil like a Pot over a Furnace: Beſides, the Room was all over ſo full of ſtinking Smoak and Vapour, that there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſeeing any thing, or diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one perſon from another, had it not been for a numerous company of Candles, that were ſet up and down round about it, the flame of which ſeemed to me to look of a blood-red colour (as we ſee the body of the <hi>Sun</hi> ſometimes to look in miſty Weather.)

               <p>THe <hi>Room,</hi> as I ſaid before, was very large and ſpacious, and yet full of Company walking to and fro, as they do at the Exchange, and talking together
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95381:19"/>
with much warmth and earneſtneſs, with ſtretching out the hand, thumping the Breaſt, and looks compoſed to ſo much auſterity, as ſomewhat exceeded the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gravity of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> tho thoſe <hi>Majeſtick Don's</hi> we know are the moſt ſolemn and grave in their deportment, of any other. Only one fellow I obſerved much to be admired, being both in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and carriage different from all the reſt of the Company; his habit was <hi>party par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pale,</hi> the one Moietie of <hi>his karkals</hi> from head to Toe, was dreſt up in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mode, with all the formal habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of a ſtrutting <hi>Don,</hi> with Beaver cockt, and arm a kimbo; the other half of him was on the contrary accoutred in a moſt ridiculous dreſs, like the <hi>Knave</hi> of <hi>Clubs,</hi> in Coat and Hoſe, with an hanging Sleeve, made up of patches of more various colours than a Taylor's Cabbage-bed, or a Party coloured Cuſhion, on that ſide of him, he wore a Cocks Feather in his Hat, and other mimical and antique accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; He was of himſelf an ugly ſquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellow, whoſe Eyes look'd nine waies at once, and that which was more ſtrange in him, his looks were as much diverſified as his habit; for look upon him on his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95381:19"/>
Spaniſh ſide, and his look was compoſed to a demure and ſupercilious gravity, rather frowning than otherwiſe; but look upon him on the other ſide and his face was all ape and ridicule, and his Jaws drawn up into the form of laughter, all fop and foolerie. I was much pleaſed with the humour of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Animal, but could not tell for the life of me what to make on't, except a Jack-a-lent, having ſeen Puppets ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Albonia,</hi> patch'd up in that manner. But <hi>Phileroy</hi> better informed me, that it was the great <hi>Biſhops Ieſter,</hi> and that he called himſelf by the name of <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>— That, ſaid I, methinks is a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Title for a man of mirth, (as Jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be) <hi>Heraclitus</hi> we know was all over ſober ſadneſs, nothing of fop in him; That's true replied <hi>Phileroy,</hi> but this Fellow acting both knave and fool has taken upon him a double part accordingly, which you ſee he repreſents both in the garb and geſture. He pretends himſelf a <hi>Tragi-comedian,</hi> and acts both <hi>Ieſt</hi> and <hi>Earneſt,</hi> upon which account he might as well have compounded his name as his humours, and called himſelf <hi>Heramocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> it would have ſounded in my mind much better, however as ſtrange a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95381:20"/>
as he appears to you. He is lookt upon here, as a very ſerviceable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Promoting the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Intereſt; being one of thoſe <hi>Faction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers</hi> (of whom there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this place) that betwixt jeſt and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt are to create diviſions, and ſet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and People at odds one with another; thus when he is in ſober earneſt, his ſerious part is employed only about dreams, and ſtories of a former Rebellion long ſince acted in <hi>Albonia;</hi> of which though the Actors are long ſince dead, and their crimes almoſt forgotten, yet this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick <hi>Whiſter</hi> would needs perſuade the <hi>Government</hi> that the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of thoſe Rebels are revived under a new form to act their old parts over again; and by this means to divert the Magiſtrates ftom all ſuſpicion of the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> party, and to believe the <hi>Albonians</hi> themſelves to be the Plotters againſt their own Country; And thus his ſerious part is made up of meer fiction and foolery, but his fooling part is compounded on the contrary of things of a moſt ſad and ſolid nature (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a true <hi>Heraclitus</hi> to weep In earneſt (the fear and troubles of the People about the Events of this helliſh
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95381:20"/>
Conſpiracy, now on foot againſt them all which (his part is to turn into droll and ridicule, and to perſuade the People, that their <hi>Governours</hi> do but laugh at them for their fooliſh fears; and that that is all the remedy they will afford to prevent them— And by this way he deſigns to jeſt the People into hard thoughts of the <hi>Government,</hi> and ſo to ſet them one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another. Well, having received this account of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> I thought him not worth any further regarding, ſo let him paſs on in his jocular huff to divert my eyes with ſome other proſpects: But here I muſt not omit to acquaint you (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſs further) with the furniture of this <hi>ſooty Pallace;</hi> there were hanging againſt the <hi>Walls</hi> of it, in ſome places, the <hi>Reliques</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Petropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Martyrs,</hi> which the <hi>great Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Conclave</hi> for their zealous ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſufferings had cannoniſed with <hi>Saintſhip;</hi> in one place was a <hi>Knife</hi> hanging beſmeared with blood, which <hi>Phileroy</hi> told me was the inſtrument wherewith <hi>Ravillaie</hi> murthered <hi>Henry the fourth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and for that fact tormented to death (as he deſerved) with moſt exquiſite tortures; next to that was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95381:21"/>
placed the dark Lanthorn of <hi>Guido Faux</hi> the <hi>Albonian</hi> Traitor, that was to have blown up the <hi>Senate Houſe,</hi> with the Aſſembly of the two <hi>grand Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Royal</hi> Family in it, had not Providence by a Diſcovery in a very ſtrange manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Deſign, for this Fact he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a deſerved puniſhmenr, but was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at <hi>Petropolis Sainted</hi> for it— there was alſo hanging by a thred a <hi>Ball,</hi> in reſemblance of the Fire-balls where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> lately ſince had deſtroyed the famous City of <hi>Londinople</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Albonia;</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Author of which, was afterwards hang'd, though the reſt by the means and interpoſition of ſome great Intereſts, for that time eſcaping, are yet reſerved for a future Vengeance—Beſides theſe were hanging ſeveral pictures the deſigns of which particularly <hi>Phileroy</hi> explained to me. One of them was a repreſentation of a moſt horrid Maſſacre, acted within the circuit of a great and populous City by the Bloody-thirſty <hi>Petropolitans</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the reſt by <hi>Croſſes</hi> and other ſignatures; the ſlaughter was ſo great, and the Villanies and Cruelties there acted (which the Painter with great Art
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95381:21"/>
had moſt lively decipher'd) ſo notorious, as made me ſhrink with horror at the ſight of it. This he told me was intended for the Maſſacre, at <hi>Lutetia,</hi> of the poor Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genot Chriſtians. A piece of ſervice eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo meritorious and grateful to the great Biſhop and his Conſiſtory, that they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Jubilee to be obſerved for it, with many other Expreſſions of Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for ſo glorious an Undertaking.</p>
               <p>The next I obſerved was that of another <hi>Maſſacre</hi> or Slaughter like the former, but varied (if poſſible) with cruelties of a more ſurpaſſing nature than other; the Painter indeed in this piece had plaid his part ſo well that all the moſt bruitiſh and barbarous Villanies that were ever acted in the World, ſeemed to be crouded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this model. The Scene of this <hi>Tragedie</hi> was a large and ſpacious <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> (yet environ'd every way with the Sea) full of Lakes, Fens and Marſhes, and very woody in ſome places. Here was to the Life deſcribed a crue of Bloody Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (bearing the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> colours) roving up and down the Country, like ſavage Tigers with Inſtruments of Death in their hands, wherewith they killed and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all they met with. In ſome places We
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95381:22"/>
might ſee Cities and Towns weltring in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive flames, while the diſtreſſed Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants flying out of the Gates for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Lives, have falln upon the Swords of their Enemies; and ſo loſt thoſe lives which by their flight they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave. Otherwhere were ſeen thoſe bruitiſh Villains gratifying their beaſtly Appetites in raviſhing Women, ſtripping of them, and ſo driving them together in herds (naked as they were) to the bogs and Rivers to drown them. Some were pictured wreſting the tender Infants from their Mothers Breſts to ſlay them, and then ſpitting them upon their Pikes to carry them about in that manner as tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their Cruelty. Theſe Slaughters (as they were there deſcribed) were ſo Univerſal, that the whole Country ſeemed but one <hi>Aceldama,</hi> or field of Blood. The Scene of this Tragedy I underſtood was <hi>Bogland</hi> or the <hi>Tories</hi> Country, and this was the Deſcription of the horrid Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre there acted ſome years ſince within our memorie, and much feared (as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi> told me) to be acted over again by the treacherous <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> who ſwarm in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> and notwithſtanding the Country is a <hi>Colony</hi> or Tributary

               <p>There were ſeveral other Pourtraits which I would have peruſed, but was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by a ſudden buſtle, that was made by the company at the coming of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with great Sachels at their Backs, which they threw down upon a long Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the end of the room, and thence took out ſeveral fardels of Paper Books, Parchments with Seals, Standiſhes, and other things neceſſary for the Conſult.

The <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf (ſaid <hi>Phileroy</hi>) the other day could not forbear laughing at the pretty odneſs of this Fellow's humour; and to ſay the truth, this whole pack of whifling, trifling, ſcribling <hi>Pragmaticos,</hi> are no other than a ſelect company of mercenary tools, that his <hi>Devilſhip</hi> has pickt up for the ſervice of the <hi>Grand Viccar</hi> and the <hi>Petropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> cauſe. Well, I had enough of this <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and before I could proceed to make any farther obſervations. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant came in (to wit) the <hi>Grand Viccar</hi> with his attendants, which conſiſted of Cardinals and other Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries</hi> of the <hi>ſuperiour Orders.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him came an <hi>Officer</hi> to make way, an ill favoured black Creature whether <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> or <hi>Devil</hi> I know not: But he made a great noiſe and buſle in preparing a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, crying out, <hi>make room</hi> for the <hi>great Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Conclave.</hi> The <hi>great Biſhop</hi> was not at this time (I perceived) in his <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in that ſumptuous manner, which he uſes to appear in at Proceſſion, or in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Audience to Ambaſſadours; but in a plain black Gown, as a colour moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Place and Buſineſs: Yet for the

greater grace of the matter, his reverend Bald-pate was covered with a <hi>Tripple Crown;</hi> the <hi>Pontife Croſier</hi> in his Hand, and his <hi>Keys</hi> at his Girdle, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his <hi>Roſarie Croſſes</hi> and other trinkets.

while our <hi>King</hi> continues <hi>Lord</hi> of the Soil, whoſe undoubted right it is to have the donation of thoſe places: next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a company of mixed Orders, ſome of them being <hi>Ignatians,</hi> others <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> and others <hi>Benedictines,</hi> all of them in the ſeveral diſtinct habits of their <hi>Order:</hi> Theſe I underſtand were a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of a diſtinct faculty, that had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the G.

I wondred ſomething at it to ſee ſo much Order obſerved in a place of Darkneſs and Confuſion, but I was told by my Friend, it was a thing not ſo much to be admired, that thoſe ambitious <hi>Church-men,</hi> that ſtood ſo much upon their Priviledges upon <hi>Earth,</hi> ſhould hold their precedencies as well here— They were no ſooner ſeated, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in the Room beginning to draw about them, but proclamation of ſilence was order'd to be made, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

this time (and ſhould be hereafter if they behaved themſelves accordingly) to their content in the place of happineſs [that is, thought I with my ſelf, The <hi>Fools Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi>] but that they came not hither upon any account of their ſervices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for him, or defect of merit in any ſuch ſervices to ſecure them from coming into ſuch miſery; but that their ſlipping it there contrary to their own expectation, and his promiſe, muſt be occaſioned either by their concealing and dying in ſome <hi>mortal</hi> ſin, without receiving <hi>Abſolution</hi> for it; or elſe they had at their death (tho they ſuffered as <hi>Martyrs</hi> at the Gallows in the Churches quarrel) confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſomething that tended to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the <hi>Churches</hi> Deſigns &amp; Intereſt, which they ought rather flatly to have denyed, or by ſome feigned Aequivocations to have concealed rather than the Church ſhould ſuffer by their plain confeſſions: One of theſe two he told them muſt needs be the cauſe of their coming into that place of miſery: And therefore by the way, he gave it as a Caution to the New-liſted <hi>Reformado's</hi> there preſent that had offered their ſervices in his and the Churches quarrel [in the preſent deſign]
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95381:30"/>
to be couragious to the death; and if ever they ſhould upon their diſcovery come to the honour of Martyrdom, that they ſhould not (to ſave their Lives) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the <hi>Churches</hi> Deſigns by any ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confeſſion which might turn to their prejudice, which if they did, they might be in danger of coming into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that theſe poor-wretches were in; but if on the contrary they perſiſted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly to vindicate the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> tho they denyed the <hi>Truth,</hi> the Crime of the Falſhood (being for the <hi>Churches</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) ſhould be pardoned, and themſelves rewarded—both with <hi>Saintſhip</hi> here, and immediate <hi>Felicity</hi> in the other <hi>World</hi>—But as for thoſe poor <hi>Souls</hi> that by their own folly had loſt the merit of their Services, and brought themſelves into that place of miſery, he bade their <hi>Keeper</hi> (whom he firſt checkt for his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence) to go back to them, and aſſure them, that after this grand buſineſs was over) he would order a Jubilee to be kept in order to releaſing them and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-priſoners.</p>
               <p>This latter part of his Oration he ſpake with an Elevated Voice, much louder than the former, intending (as I fancied) that it

ſhould reach the Ears of the <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> but the former part he ſpake ſo low, that the Company in the Room could hardly underſtand him; this he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, that thoſe Apologies that he made for ſuffering them to come into that place, might not be underſtood by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, leſt they ſhould reply upon him, and return him back the Lye he had given them; which he knew might poſſibly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſuch broyls between them as might make the place too hot for him to ſtay in (tho it were warm enough already.)

               <p>After which their Inſtructions were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe read to them as the former, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which was,</p>

               <p>But in order to the more <hi>grand</hi> deſign of <hi>Subverting</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> (as the Gap by which the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> were moſt probably to enter) they were with thoſe conſecrated Inſtruments of Death and Deſtruction delivered to them, by themſelves (or their agents) to deſtroy the ſacred perſon of the <hi>Albonian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> and all others commiſſionated by him, that were known Enemies to the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> State.

Bleſſing. I expected to ſee no more of them, till I ſhould meet them at the Gallows, and then I ſhould ſee how well they obſerved their Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Next to theſe came up an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Church-men</hi> in more coſtly habits than any of the former, and ſeemed by their Garb and going to be none of the ſmall Prophets, but ſome ſpecial <hi>Dignitaries</hi> amongſt them. Theſe, <hi>Phileroy</hi> told me, were <hi>Provincials</hi> inveſted with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencies</hi> over the ſeveral inferiour <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and were according to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to hold their reſidencies in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Petropolitan Countries</hi> as namely the <hi>Catholick Provinces, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia, Caſtilia,</hi> &amp;c. Where they had their ſeveral Titles and Juriſdictions; and theſe were to hold Correſpondence, and to give directions to thoſe <hi>Provincials</hi> in <hi>Albonia,</hi> and other places that were inferiour and ſubject to them, as namely, Father <hi>Paulus d' Oliva</hi> Provincial gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, preſiding the <hi>Ignatian Order,</hi> was to direct the Conſults and Managements of that Order reſiding at <hi>Londinopolis,</hi> and had a particular Commiſſion delivered to him to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Then came up Mounſieur <hi>Ieronimo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95381:52"/>
Provincial</hi> of the <hi>Ignatians</hi> in <hi>novo Caſtilio</hi> whoſe <hi>inſtructions</hi> were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form of his Commiſſion, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch of that Order, that were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſent Deſign, with Counſel and Mony, and to miſrepreſent the actions and intentions of the <hi>Albonian</hi> Monarch in the <hi>Catholick</hi> Court, ſo as to create Jealouſies and Feuds between the Two Crowns; as knowing that as the Intereſt of their Kingdoms did oblige them to a mutual amitie; ſo ſuch an amitie would be inconſiſtent with the intereſt of their preſent Deſigns, and very much hinder their proceedings, unleſs it were ſome way broken, or diſturbed by them.</p>
               <p>Enter next Father <hi>le Cheſe,</hi> an <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> who though no <hi>Provincial,</hi> yet being a perſon of great Eminence and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as being Confeſſor to the <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Monarch,</hi> was thought fit to have his place amongſt the aforeſaid <hi>Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> He was it ſeems a notable <hi>Sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politico</hi> of that Order in whoſe Policies the <hi>grand Biſhop</hi> repoſed much Confidence as to this Affair; and beſides was a great Friend of the <hi>Secretaries,</hi> with whom, when in <hi>Albonia,</hi> he was to hold a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, but very private Correſpondence
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95381:53"/>
by Ciphers and Figures, whereby the ſaid <hi>Secretary</hi> was to inform the ſaid Father <hi>le Cheſe,</hi> and he to inform his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the <hi>Franconian Prince</hi> with all the moſt conſiderable matters of State, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they ſhould take their meaſures, and for his Encouragement in ſuch ſervices, the <hi>moſt Petropolitan Monarch</hi> would allow him a conſiderable penſion, (as the Reward of his Treaſons.) I perceived the <hi>Secretary</hi> in ſpeaking to him, did obſerve more than Ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards him, but had he then known what afterwards I knew happened, that his negotiations with him ſhould be rewarded with an Halter, I ſuppoſe he would not at this time have been ſo offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Obſervances to him.</p>
               <p>This Service indeed was dangerous and difficult to manage in the Court of a <hi>Ch i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince,</hi> and ſuch an one whoſe own known ſagacity, beſides the aſſiſtance of an able and diſcrete Council, might very probably, in good time, diſcover, and ſo prevent ſuch treaſonable Correſpondencies: but the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Politicians are men too bold and daring to ſtart at dangers, tho they lie in immediate proſpect, their uſual Motto being <hi>Neck or nothing,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95381:53"/>
when (like fooliſh hardy people, ruſhing themſelves from precipices) they venture upon ſuch deſperate attempts in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their ambitious imployers.</p>
               <p>The laſt of this company, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to the Board, was another <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial;</hi> that by his looks and geſture ſeemed to be an <hi>Albonian,</hi> and ſo indeed he was (as <hi>Phileroy</hi> informed me) an own dear <hi>Traitor</hi> Countryman of ours, that out of his deviliſh Zeal to the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Cauſe, was going (with the reſt of his <hi>parrieidian</hi> crue) to deſtroy his own natural <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi> I asked <hi>Phileroy</hi> the name of this <hi>Monſter,</hi> he told me his ſurname was <hi>Strange,</hi> but by what name of Baptiſm he was called, whether <hi>Roger,</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> he knew not, but that he was commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated to be <hi>Provincial</hi> over the <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in <hi>Albonia,</hi> whoſe Inſtructions were no other than that he ſhould govern and direct them in the management of this <hi>Deſign,</hi> according to their general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and as he ſhould be Ordered from time to time by the <hi>Father general</hi> at <hi>Petropolis.</hi> Theſe were all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (ſo near as I can remember) of this <hi>Gang,</hi> who having ſeverally diſcharged

their Duty at the <hi>Board,</hi> went off as the former.</p>
               <p>I thought there would be no end of this tragical Proceſſion, the ſcenes multiplying ſo faſt one after another, and to ſay truth I began to be almoſt tired with beholding them: But <hi>Phileroy</hi> told me there was one <hi>Order</hi> more to come up in the rear of theſe, who were an <hi>Albonian</hi> Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, called <hi>Benedictines,</hi> to whom his <hi>Viccarſhip</hi> (of his ſpecial Bounty) had by his Pattent granted an ancient and goodly Structure (ſometime the reſidence of the <hi>Albonian</hi> Princes) ſcituate in <hi>Londino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> called <hi>Savoy,</hi> which they were to uſe and enjoy as a <hi>Colledge</hi> for their <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> therein to repoſe their Library and ſacred Utenſils, and to manage there their <hi>Conſults</hi> with the reſt of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as they ſhould ſee occaſion; there was a pretty number of them I ſaw draw up to the Board, moſt of which by their Countenances ſeemed to be <hi>Albonians,</hi> but what they did there, or what was ſaid, I minded not; for the truth is, at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this, I fell into a deep fit of muſing, thinking with my ſelf of the preſumptuous arrogance of the <hi>Petropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Biſhop,</hi> who would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

only to let his deſtructive Beagles to skulk up and down in ſhelters, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where their Company was ſo much abhorred and hated, but ſhould aſſign them ſo publick a place in the midſt of a populous <hi>City,</hi> and near to the <hi>Princes</hi> Court (as it was) to kennel in.

marching up in great haſte (as if he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himſelf) towards the Table; he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by his habit to be an <hi>Albonian,</hi> and was a ſpare thin-faced old man, pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tall, having over his other cloaths a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>long ſcarlet Gown and Hood, ſuch as in <hi>Albonia</hi> are uſed by thoſe of the Degree of <hi>Doctor;</hi> to ſatisfie my curioſity, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi> told me that he knew him very well, and that he was an <hi>Albonian Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician:</hi> (A <hi>Phyſician</hi> (ſaid I) what need is there of ſuch here) their province being to ſave mens <hi>lives;</hi> but thoſe are all for deſtroying them.

After we had packt up the things, we withdrew to the little Window, where we ſaw a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Sailors</hi> (who were ſent for to that purpoſe) with burdens on their backs to carry them down to the Ships; amongſt the reſt that were unburthened <hi>Phileroy</hi> ſaw five or ſix jolly <hi>Albonian Sailors,</hi> that belonged to the Veſſel that we were to go in, and calling out to one of them by his name, to take his parcel with him, which we together heaving down Stairs, the <hi>fellow</hi> took upon his back and went off with it, telling us we had now a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gale of Wind for <hi>Albonia.</hi> I would have had <hi>Phileroy</hi> that we ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him; but he told me he muſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95381:64"/>
ſtay till the reſt of the Company, that were to go along with us were ready; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Companies that we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yeſterday, we ſaw marching off one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another. I perceived they were moſt of them now (if not all) in <hi>Lay</hi> habits, their <hi>Monkiſh</hi> Veſts and trumpery being ſent before, truſſed up in their baggage; nay, <hi>Phileroy</hi> himſelf had now left off his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and put himſelf into an <hi>Albonian</hi> habit. I told him, he now looked like <hi>Phileroy</hi> himſelf, but he cautioned me not to call him by that name, which he durſt not own amongſt thoſe people, but <hi>Petrophil,</hi> which was the name he had aſſumed, and was known by amongſt the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> to whom he knew the other name would be odious, and a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intimation to them of what he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal; I promiſed to obſerve his Direction. After this the next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that appeared, was the <hi>Grand Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> himſelf (with ſome harbingers before him) and his <hi>Scarlet Senate</hi> following; but they were all now (even the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> himſelf) in black Coats (I ſuppoſe their uſual travelling habits) girt cloſe to them. <hi>Phileroy</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> marching along, ſuddenly drew up
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95381:65"/>
towards him, and I followed him at a ſmall diſtance; The <hi>Viccar</hi> I perceived preſently took notice of him (<hi>Phileroy</hi> making a very low Obeyſance to him) and ſaid, I ſee <hi>Petrophil</hi> you are prepared for your Voyage, Pray remember us to all our Friends in <hi>Albonia,</hi> and to our <hi>Rebellious</hi> Son your <hi>King,</hi> when you ſee him, (I imagined what kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance His <hi>Viccarſhip</hi> meant) <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi> acquainted His Unholineſs he would do both; the latter I am ſure he did ſoon after to ſome purpoſe, though quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Great Biſhop</hi>'s meaning. This was all that paſſed betwixt them, the <hi>Viccar</hi> went on; and preſently after came up the <hi>Company</hi> we waited for, that we were to go along with, with whom we joyned our ſelves, and marching the way we came in at, through the <hi>dark Entry,</hi> we aſcended the <hi>brow</hi> of the <hi>Hill,</hi> and ſo down again to the <hi>Harbour,</hi> where our <hi>Veſſel</hi> lay ready to take us in; we got to it by a <hi>Shallop</hi> ſent out to fetch us, and being on Board, the Seamen preſently <hi>hoiſed Sail,</hi> and having a fair Wind with us, ſet forward, and in a few daies came to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor at one of the <hi>five Ports</hi> in <hi>Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:95381:65"/>During the time of our Voyage, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi> brought me into ſome acquaintance with thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Albonians</hi> before mentioned, with whom, when we could get opportunity, we diſcourſed together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preſent affairs, and how we ſhould do to circumvent the Deſigns laid againſt us; to which end we reſolved, when we were got into <hi>Albonia,</hi> to keep together, and to have frequent meetings in order to conſidering of the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ways to do it.</p>
               <p>At our firſt landing upon our <hi>Native Soil,</hi> we went altogether in a company to a <hi>Tavern,</hi> to congratulate each other upon our happy arrival, but chiefly to attend our <hi>Provincial</hi> who came along with us, and to receive his Commands, where we were to wait upon him at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinopolis,</hi> (the chief place intended of our Rendevouz) in order to our Conſults; which he having informed us, and an health drunk round to the good ſucceſs of the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Deſign, (which we, that were <hi>abhorrers</hi> to it, durſt not, for that time, but pledge) we parted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, betaking our ſelves to our ſeveral Inns. <hi>Phileroy,</hi> my ſelf, and our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Country-men ſtill keeping Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

together, (as we had before reſolved) both that night and the next, (taking up places in the Stage Coaches belonging to the Town) we journeyed together to <hi>Londinopolis,</hi> where we all deſired to be, for that all our particular Concerns lay in that place.</p>

               <p>And according to my Wiſh, the next day he ſent to me to meet at a place near by, I preſently went to him, and after uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al civilities paſt beween us, I preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with my <hi>Dream</hi> yeſterday which he liſtned to with good attention; and then asked me if my Memory would ſerve to deſcribe the ſeveral perſons I ſaw there; I told him yes, and accordingly did as near as I could remember deſcribe them to him; whereupon he told me that my <hi>Viſion</hi> was a <hi>real</hi> thing, and that thoſe five Perſons were five <hi>Noblemen</hi> of great Eſtates in <hi>Albonia,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Ignatian,</hi> who together with ſome others had, in purſuance of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions received at <hi>Strombolo,</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and diſpoſed the aforeſaid <hi>Lords,</hi> both by voluntary <hi>Contributions</hi> out of their Eſtates, and otherwiſe to give in their aſſiſtances from time to time to the carrying on of the preſent Deſign: As

                  <hi>Secretary,</hi> he acquainted the Board how ſucceſsfully he had engaged his Maſter the <hi>Great Duke</hi> to the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and what an amity and Correſpondence he had maintained between his ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and Mr. <hi>le Cheſe</hi> Confeſſor to the great <hi>Franconian</hi> Monarch, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter in that Court; and had ſo far prevailed (by his Letters) with him in the behalf of the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> here, that the ſaid <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> had ſent over the Sum of 10000 <abbr>

for ſuch uſes as they ſhould be imployed for.

                  </abbr> you may think (ſaid <hi>Phileroy</hi>) that they ſhould not know how to imploy ſo vaſt a Revenue; but if you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (beſides what is neceſſary for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their numerous ſelves) the charges of their Conſults, ſending away diſpatches, buying up of Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition (whereof they intend to have great Stores and Magazins (concealed) in ſeveral Counties) the allowing of Penſions, beſides exceſſive Rewards (for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

not to be ſparing) to ſuch as ſhall perform any ſignal or deſperate Services for them. I ſay, lay all theſe together and it will abate your Wonder. I was very well pleaſed to hear from <hi>Phileroy,</hi> that the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> were ſo rich and able, hoping in time when they ſhould come to be diſcovered; Our <hi>King</hi> himſelf would be never the worſe for it; very likely ſo, ſaid <hi>Phileroy.</hi> But to proceed in my Narrative, as this was a general <hi>Conſult,</hi> ſo the principal Deſign of it was to conſider of a ſpeedy way of cutting off the King, whoſe ſacred life (which <hi>God</hi> long continue) they looked upon as the greateſt <hi>Remora</hi> to their <hi>Deſigns;</hi> ſeveral perſons came and offered to be employed in it; They refuſed none, but took them in all, that they might make ſure Work on't, and though they laid their Deſigns ſeveral wayes, yet they, whoſe Deſigns took firſt, were likely to be beſt rewarded; yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had a round Sum propounded for his Encouragement.</p>
               <p>The firſt that came up and offered his Service on this Deſign, was the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Drugſter</hi> the old <hi>Phiſitian</hi> that we ſaw at <hi>Strombolo,</hi> who having, as I there told you, by the means of ſome great <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:95381:72"/>
Friends, crept into ſo much favour as to be attendant to the <hi>Royal Conſort</hi> had ſo much the fairer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perpetrating his Deſigns; The doſe of conſecrated poiſon, that we ſaw the <hi>Great Biſhop</hi> deliver to him at <hi>Strom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo,</hi> was the Inſtrument he choſe for the diſpatch of his <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as moſt ſuitable to his faculty; but for the doſe of Gold then alſo given, he eſteemed that but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fee, he reſolved he would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Neck for nothing, but ſtood gaping as he uſed to do over his ſick Patients after he had diſpatched his <hi>Recipe's,</hi> expecting the Propoſal. The <hi>Provincial</hi> propoſed 15000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> (too great a Reward for a <hi>Traitor,</hi> but too little a price to value the life of ſuch a <hi>King</hi> at) part of which was to be paid him down by the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> of <hi>Londinopolis,</hi> and the other to be likewiſe paid him when the Deſign was perfected. Whether he liked the proffer I know not, but I ſuppoſe he did; for having withdrawn from the Board with a low Obeyſance, he promiſed to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; after he was withdrawn came up three perſons two of them in <hi>Prieſts</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, the other in a <hi>Lay</hi> one: One of theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> was to contrive the way and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95381:73"/>
Method of the Deſign, the other two were to execute it, and the way then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, was that they ſhould take ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the <hi>King</hi>'s walking private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <hi>Royal Park,</hi> and then to ſhoot him, to which purpoſe they had each of them a Piſtol delivered to them, with ſilver Bullets (forſooth) becauſe they were to ſoak in Royal Blood (which God grant they never may.) Theſe Piſtols, being made of a length more than ordinary, that they might do Execution the further, were firſt conſecrated by the <hi>Provincial</hi> in the name of the <hi>Oreat Biſhop,</hi> the Rewards propoſed to them for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was to one of them (being the <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>) the Sum of 1500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> 30000 Miſſals, which at 12 <abbr>

                  </abbr> a Maſs (the uſual rate of that Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) amounts to the like Sum. After theſe came up four rude, <hi>ruffianly,</hi> hectoring Blades, I underſtand they were <hi>Tories</hi> or Inhabitants of <hi>Bogland,</hi> their very looks ſpoke Death and Terror, fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſuch a purpoſe; theſe boldly busſling up to the <hi>Board,</hi> offering their Services, that they four, or ſome of them ſhould ſhoot the <hi>King</hi> at one of his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Pallaces</hi> Weſtward, where he was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95381:73"/>
then retired, as ſoon as they could find an opportunity fair to do it; their Motion was preſently accepted, but what rewards were agreed upon I could not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; being withdrawn to the other end of the Room, they ſtayed not long, but they withdrew alſo with a Complement, but at a huffing rate, with their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Swords, as if they had been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going about the Execution of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. After a little ſpace, all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Undertakers were called up again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to receive the <hi>Provincial</hi>'s Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but indeed to take the Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, an old, but cunning Invention of the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> to oblige underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to the moſt obſtinate ſilence; this <hi>Oath</hi> was made Penal with Imprecations of no leſs than Hell and Damnation to the Violators of it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Phileroy's</hi> Proceedings about making a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The <hi>Grand Caſhier</hi>'s practiſes to ſtifle it. The <hi>Petropolitans</hi> Practices to ſeduce the People under ſeveral religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſguiſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ACcording to this Appointment I met him a few daies after at our uſual place of Meeting, and having conferred notes a little of what we had obſerved ſince we came to Town. I told him my Thoughts (which I knew was agreeable enough to his mind) concerning a <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> He told me (with a look much more troubled than ever I had ſeen him with before) that while this <hi>horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi> againſt his <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> lay concealed in his boſom, he carried a fire within him much more hot than the place we came from; but for him at that time to attempt a <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> being a ſtranger at <hi>Court,</hi> and knowing no <hi>great
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95381:75"/>
Perſon</hi> there, whoſe acquaintance ſhould be a means of his Introduction, and give Credit to his Teſtimony, he thought would be altogether in vain; and beſides the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> party being now all in Town that knew him, ſhould he attempt a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> before he had got ſome protection from the higher Powers for his ſecurity, he ſhould be in continual danger to have his Life and Evidence taken off together. But withal he told me he would acquaint me with a ſecret, which he had never yet revealed to me or any one, which was, That the <hi>Provincial Blanc-pain</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to murther an eminent <hi>Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Divine one Dr. <hi>Tongus,</hi> who had lately put forth a Book, called, the <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Morals,</hi> a Book ſo palpably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the Villanies of that Party, that in revenge thereof they had engaged him to that barbarous ſervice of cutting him off. But, ſaid <hi>Phileroy,</hi> I have conſidered with my ſelf, that taking hold of this Thread, I might poſſibly unravel the whole bottom of their <hi>Deſigns;</hi> and therefore I have purpoſed to go forthwith to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and firſt to acquaint him with the Miſchief intended againſt himſelf, and then to inform him of the Plot in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95381:75"/>
(in its various Contrivances) againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> to which end I have drawn up a Paper conſiſting of forty three Articles, and containing the general heads of my <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> which I intend to deliver to him, and withal to engage his aſſiſtance (being a perſon of ſo much Note and Eminency) to get it preferred to (him whom it moſt concerns) the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, with a Promiſe to appear my ſelf to juſtifie it, when ever I ſhall be thereto required.</p>
               <p>This project of <hi>Phileroy</hi>'s did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well pleaſe me, wiſhing him without delay to proceed upon it, and withal to give me an account of the Reſult at our next Meeting.</p>
               <p>Which accordingly he did, for then looking with a more gay and pleaſant Countenance than before, he told me mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that he had been at Confeſſion; but ſaid he, it was to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and not a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> tho I wiſh I may not come to be pennanced by them for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In fine, he acquainted me how that he had been with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and made his Diſcoveries to him, not only of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt himſelf, but that againſt the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95381:76"/>
                  <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> both which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted very kindly; and as for the latter (as a loyal Subject concerned for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Prince) he had ingaged a <hi>Noble Collonel</hi> (a Perſon great at <hi>Court</hi>) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Articles into the <hi>King</hi>'s own hand) which he accordingly did, taking a fit opportunity for his purpoſe, as the <hi>King</hi> was for his Recreation walking in his Park. And His Majeſty received the ſame very graciouſly from him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at his return from his Walk, vouchſaft to hear him more particulary of the Treaſon intended againſt him, as alſo an account of the Traitors themſelves, their Names and Characters. But being more ſecure in his own Innocency, than aware of the danger threatned him, and being to go the next day to one of his Royal Pallaces in the Country, told him he would leave the Papers in the hands of his <hi>Oreat Caſhier,</hi> and ordered the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel to attend him, that he might put him in mind of them, a Perſon whom he ſaid he could confide in, but one that has ſince proved himſelf too much a friend to his Enemies, but not ſo much a friend to his Maſter, as the Duty of his <hi>Place,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Rewards of it ſhould have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95381:76"/>
him to have been, eſpecially in an Affair of this Nature, wherein no leſs than the Life of his <hi>Soveraign</hi> was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For, ſaid <hi>Phileroy,</hi> altho for the more clear evidencing of the Deſign, it was offered him to produce the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould perpretrate the intended Murther (with their Weapons and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Death about them) in ſuch time as the <hi>King</hi> ſhould happen to take a Walk next in the aforeſaid Park, and although farther the <hi>Collonel</hi> acquainted him with a means how to ſeiſe the Letters of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents, which might give a further light to the Diſcovery, yet all theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities were ſlighted or neglected by him: Neither would he permit any acceſs to him by the <hi>Diſcoveror,</hi> to give in his farther Information; bur put him off with delays from time to time, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any notice taken of this <hi>important</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; ſo that the Progreſs of our <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> being retarded thus by one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo much a <hi>friend</hi> to the <hi>Petropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans,</hi> we are in danger of being <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> our ſelves before we can make out our <hi>Diſcovery</hi> againſt them.</p>
               <p>I was much dampt to hear that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> ſhould be thus ſlighted by a man in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95381:77"/>
                  <hi>Power,</hi> and ſo near to the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the <hi>grand Caſhier</hi> (by his place) was; and withal I feared by this Inſtance, that the treacherous <hi>Petropolitans</hi> had corrupted more ſuch men as he was, and by Bribes, or otherwiſe, drawn them over to their Intereſt; and, ſaid I, if they have gained this point of us, to infeeble thoſe that ſhould be the Supporters of our State, and to render them defenceleſs to us, we may well give over ſtirring and leave them to play out their game; for who ſhall hinder them?</p>
               <p>That will I (replied <hi>Phileroy</hi> bravely) ſo long as I am ſure the main Pillar of all ſtands faſt, and unſhaken: I mean His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to whom I am reſolved, ſeeing I can have no better ſucceſs with his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> to go my ſelf as ſoon as ever I can find means of acceſs to his preſence, and give in my Informations my ſelf to him, and leave it to his own Royal Breaſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of his own and his <hi>Kingdoms</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; I very well approved of his <hi>Reſolve,</hi> and encouraged him by all means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and to leave no means unattempted till he had perfected his Diſcovery. After a little more chat paſſed concerning this and other matters, we broke up for this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95381:77"/>
time, leaving the reſt to our next Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>During which time, our <hi>Petropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Friends ſwarmed about the Town; for I met with one or other of them very often as I walked in the Streets, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their various diſguiſes, I knew them by their faces to be the ſame perſons that came over with us from <hi>Strombolo.</hi> One of them (that I knew to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi>) I ſaw go huffing along in an <hi>Hectorian</hi> Garb, Hat buttoned up, a long Periwig, and a Rapier by his ſide, I avoided taking notice of him for that time; but the next <hi>Sunday</hi> in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, going by an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> Meeting, I looked in, and ſaw my Gentleman again in another Garb, being new caſt into a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Form,</hi> a ſhort black Cloak, black Cap, and prickt Ears (the <hi>ambuſcading</hi> Periwig being now laid aſide) little Collar Band, and other preciſe accoutrements, and having got into the <hi>Speaking-place</hi> or Pulpit, he was thus with great vehemence and earneſtneſs preaching to the unwary people. This was a <hi>Seminarian</hi> or <hi>Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> and I perceived by this Inſtance, how cloſe they kept to their Inſtructions. I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95381:78"/>
ſtayed not long to hear his Diſcourſe, which all tended to <hi>Sedition,</hi> and to incenſe his auditors againſt the Government, but withdrew to the next neighbouring <hi>Church,</hi> where I heard ſomething more profitable: Not long after upon a week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I happened to go by a meeting of the <hi>Enlightened men,</hi> as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or <hi>Quakers,</hi> as we call them, where my curioſity again leading me in amongſt them, I obſerved another of our <hi>Strombolians,</hi> a <hi>Seminary,</hi> that was perkt up, and holding forth, as they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do, with an obſtreperous noiſe, and exceſſive bawling, ſtretching his Jaws and diſtorting his Looks with ſuch uncouth poſtures, that <hi>Strombolo</hi> itſelf could not afford a more <hi>ugly</hi> Viſage; he was in a plain, and untrimmed coloured Suit, after the guiſe of that <hi>whimſical</hi> People, who place more <hi>Superſtition</hi> in holding to their own litle Singularities, <hi>in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to other men in their Garb and Speaking,</hi> than any they can find in thoſe they moſt condemn for it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>good Lord!</hi> what a farce of <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule</hi> and <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> did I hear from the Mouth of this cunning <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> who had ſo well learned their way of <hi>Cant,</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:95381:78"/>
that he could artificially diſſemble his Reaſon, and ſpeak without it as well as they themſelves: All that his extravagant bawling tended to, was no other than to inform them of the <hi>miſerable Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that their dear Brethren of the Light had ſuffered, and were like to ſuffer from the Prieſts and men of this World, ſuch as have denied the Truth and walk in Darkneſs; but the time of Vengeance was now come, yea, Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at the very door, the Decree was paſt, the Nations ſhould be judg'd, and the Powers of the World ſhould be ſhaken, and then the Saints ſhould be all of one Heart and one Way;</hi> with abundance of other ſuch nonſenſical Stuff, whoſe Coherencies were like Ropes of twiſted Sand, without any coheſion: But theſe were the <hi>Seeds</hi> (Seditions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) that this ſubtle <hi>Seminary</hi> ſowed in the impreſſible heads of this <hi>bigotted</hi> party, who were ready enough to take any <hi>Impreſsions</hi> of this Nature. I tired my ſelf for about a quarter of an hour in hearing his <hi>Harangue,</hi> and then drew off to follow my occaſions. But the next day happening to go again that way, in a little Ally, hard by the aforeſaid Meeting-place,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95381:79"/>
whom ſhould I ſee in a little <hi>Coblers</hi> Stall, but the aforeſaid <hi>Speaking man</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> mending of Shoes; I knew him again exactly, and had a great deſire to have a little private Conference with him, which to accompliſh the better, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to a door near by, and looſening the Heel of my Shoe, by knocking it againſt the Grunſel, I went to the next <hi>Alehouſe</hi> and ſent it to the ſaid <hi>Coblers</hi> to mend, and to bring it thither to me, which in a little time he accordingly did, and I paid him for his work: And now being alone in a room by our ſelves, I cauſed him to ſit down and drink with me, and then fell to queſtion him after this manner: I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if he was not a <hi>Quaker?</hi> he told me he was one of thoſe whom the men of the <hi>World</hi> in ſcorn called ſo; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not yeſterday preach to his <hi>Brethren?</hi> he told me he did then ſpeak to them the words of Truth and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs as the <hi>Spirit</hi> moved him; Come, come, ſaid I, (reſolving to be plain with him) you are no <hi>Quaker</hi> but a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> I know you well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. 'Tis unexpreſſible what a ſtrange damp and confuſion theſe words of mine put him into, as appeared by the ſudden
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95381:79"/>
alteration in his Countenance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he began ſtoutly, and with ſome ſhew of abhorrency, to deny it, till I told him it was a folly for him ſo to do, having my ſelf ſeen him at the <hi>Conſult</hi> at <hi>Strombolo,</hi> and come over with him from thence in the ſame <hi>Veſſel;</hi> which upon better obſerving of me, he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be true, as knowing me by the Companionſhip I had with <hi>Phileroy</hi> in that <hi>Voyage;</hi> whereupon taking a little more heart of Grace, as thinking he had met with a <hi>Petropolitan;</hi> He enquires of me whether I was of the ſame <hi>Order</hi> with <hi>Phileroy;</hi> which (not being willing at this time to be known what I was) I told him I was, whereupon my new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del'd <hi>man of Light</hi> began to be more free and open with me, telling me the reaſon of his Undertaking: That he was before his entring into the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> by profeſſion, a <hi>Shoe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and that (the better to diſguiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) in the management of his part in this grand affair, which he preſumed, was well enough known to me, he had taken upon him now (ſince his return over) the Imployment of a Tranſlator (or a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker tranſlated) which being generally a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95381:80"/>
ſociable faculty, and none more talkative over their Cups than they are, he had thereby opportunity to inſinuate himſelf into the good opinion of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the <hi>Enlightened herd,</hi> whoſe company he moſtly uſed ſo far, that for his pretended Zeal to the humours of that idle <hi>Faction,</hi> he was ſoon admitted a Member, and quickly after a <hi>Teacher</hi> in their <hi>phrentick Meetings,</hi> and thereby got into great Eſteem amongſt them, and queſtioned not but by this means, he ſhould win over many of them to the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> Intereſt; of which his Service in this particular <hi>Agency,</hi> he intended to give the <hi>Provincial</hi> a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the next <hi>Conſult.</hi> I asked him when that would be; he told me the time and place, and I promiſed him then and there to meet him, wiſhing him in the mean while (but very feignedly) good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in his Undertakings, and ſo after a draught or two to our better acquaintance, my <hi>Gentle-craftsman</hi> and I for this time parted, he again to his ſtall, and I to my buſineſs.</p>

After he had thus pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced me, and his anger began to cool a little, I got liberty to ſpeak for my ſelf, and then I told him that he was wrongfully poſſeſt againſt me; for that I never was with the King ſince my coming over into <hi>Albonia,</hi> which I affirmed to him (as truly I might) with many ſolemn Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The <hi>Provincial</hi> knew we had no <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> to lye or equivocate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves, though we might do it with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and ſo ſeemed to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with my <hi>Vindication,</hi> and after an unjuſt Pennance gave me his Abſolution, only as a further trial of my faſtneſs to them I was to prepare my ſelf for a ſudden Voyage beyond Seas, where I was to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate ſome ſpecial buſineſs for them.</p>
               <p>An account of theſe Paſſages betwixt the <hi>Provincial</hi> and me I preſently gave in to the <hi>Doctor</hi> and the <hi>noble Collonel,</hi>

who thereupon perceiving that our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns</hi> of a <hi>Diſcovery</hi> had taken ſcent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, concluded that without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay we muſt with all Vigour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Undertaking; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Collonel</hi> reſolved the next day to take a journey into the Country to the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> in the mean while was to get his <hi>Informations</hi> ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to render them more authentique when they ſhould come to be examined by <hi>Authority;</hi> purſuant to which Reſolves, the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſoon after went before one Sir <hi>Edmond,</hi> a worthy <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and true friend to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Intereſt, before whom he took his <hi>Oath</hi> of the truth of his <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> as they were contained in Papers there ſhewed to the <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> but without permitting him to read over the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but that in general they contained <hi>matters of Treaſon and other high Crimes,</hi> and that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Copies of them: In the mean while the <hi>Collonel</hi> attending at the Court, found that the <hi>great Duke</hi>'s Confeſſor had, by ſome prepoſſeſſions to take off the credit of our <hi>Informations,</hi> obſtructed his way ſo that after two days waiting he could not

This account his <hi>Greatneſs</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be well pleaſed with, yet put him off then, and ſo delayed him from time to time, that he could never get to ſpeak with him, but was forced with theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, after a long attendance, to return back again to <hi>Londinopolis.</hi>

               <p>During theſe tranſactions of the <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> and the <hi>Doctors,</hi> I was forced to hold on my Correſpondencies with my <hi>Ignatian</hi> Brethren, whom I durſt not quite fall off from, till our Diſcovery had got ſo much credit as to afford me a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection againſt their malice.</p>
               <p>And this that I ſo much deſired, was ſoon after by a ſtrange accident (I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but ordered by Providence, as well for the preſervation of the Kingdom as my ſelf) effectually brought to paſs; for being one day at the <hi>Provincials</hi> houſe, where ſeveral <hi>Ignatians</hi> were attending to receive their Orders, I was ſtanding without the Door, and heard them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing together about diſpoſing of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

round about him on both ſides were ſeated an illuſtrious company of <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi> in moſt magnificent Robes, with <hi>Coronets</hi> on their heads, which I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was the Peerage of the Realm; and this to be the <hi>Vpper Order</hi> of the <hi>Great Senate</hi> or Aſſembly of Eſtates convened in this place, amongſt whom all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Intereſt of <hi>King</hi> and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are firſt judiciouſly conſulted, and then ſuch <hi>Votes, Orders</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereupon, as they think needful to the purpoſe.</p>

               <p>Some time after methought I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Weſt parts of the City, where I met with a crew of <hi>Matchmen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> that guarded along three or four perſons, whoſe dejected looks well enough ſhewed what their Condition was; One of them (looking wiſtly in his face) I knew to be a <hi>Petropolitan Prieſt,</hi> one of thoſe that came over with us from <hi>Strombolo.</hi> I was glad to ſee theſe Beaſts of prey to be taken in our Toils; but did not preſently underſtand who it was that chaſed them thither, till hearing a voice behind me crying out, look well to your <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</hi> I looked back and ſaw one follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them dreſt after the Mode of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonian Clergy</hi> and followed at a ſmall diſtance by a party of the Royal Guards, obſerving him more wiſtly, I knew him to be <hi>Phileroy,</hi> I did not ſo much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at his <hi>Divinity Habit,</hi> as knowing he had <hi>Title</hi> to it by thoſe <hi>ſacred Orders</hi>

which he had taken up in <hi>Albonia</hi> before he fell in with the <hi>Petropolitans;</hi> the <hi>Guards</hi> I imagined were thoſe allowed him for his defence in thoſe dangerous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; notwithſtanding his haſt and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I could not forbear ſpeaking to him, but his haſt would not permit him to parly with me, only taking me by the hand he whiſpered me in the Ear, that he would meet in the Evening at the uſual place, and treat me with a <hi>feaſt</hi> of Wonders. I expected indeed, having not had his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a conſiderable time ſince, to be now extraordinarily treated with accounts of things which I perceived began to work now very briskly; ſo with much ſeeming impatience, and with a world of fancies, that like <hi>Atoms</hi> flutter'd up and down in my <hi>heated</hi> brains, I <hi>dreamed</hi> away the time till Evening, and then poſted to the place where I was to meet with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had got thither (luckily) before me, and I found him with his <hi>Royal Guard of Partizans</hi> about him, and a Bottle of Wine upon the Table, which after I had ſaluted the Company, we drank about, <hi>Phileroy</hi> being pleaſed at that time (tho a thing not uſual with him) to begin an

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:95381:89"/>
whom I carryed before the Council, and having proved my charge againſt them, they were by Order of that Sacred Board committed to the <hi>Den of Thieves,</hi> the fitteſt receptacle for ſuch Cattle. But to proceed in my Narrative of the State of things ſince we were laſt together, I then told you that upon my <hi>Diſcovery</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed to allow me a Guard for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (as you ſee I am now attended with) otherwiſe it had been impoſſible for me to have ventured upon diſcovering of the traiterous gang (which was the province I was now enjoyned to) without apparent danger to my own Life; yet being thus <hi>guarded,</hi> and as well defended within by my own Innocency, I have made many bold Sallies into the retreats of my <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured</hi> Friends, but now revengeful <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and have not left till I have left them in the hands of Juſtice.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95381:89"/>
according to the Method of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, I went on with the reſt in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the next being the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> before mentioned, I got a <hi>Summons</hi> from the <hi>Privy Council</hi> for him to appear before that <hi>Board,</hi> where I juſtified my charge againſt him of his Undertaking to <hi>poiſon</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and did prove it by a Letter under the hand of <hi>Provincial Blanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain</hi> to one of the Confederates, that he had, for the Reward of 15000 <abbr>

                  </abbr> of the ſaid Mony had been already paid him (as an earneſt) by the Secretary; The Defence he made for himſelf was nothing to the purpoſe, or any denial of the fact, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an inſolent kind of boaſting of his <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> expreſſed in ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Services</hi> done by him; what thoſe <hi>Services</hi> were I knew not, but what the preſent <hi>Service</hi> was I knew ſo well, that I hoped he would be rewarded according to his deſerts; however for that time he got off <hi>impune,</hi> but ſome littte time after was taken into Cuſtody, and committed <hi>Priſoner</hi> to the <hi>Den of Thieves,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of his <hi>Companions.</hi>

proſtrate at their murderous feet: The News of this Tragedy was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently known; but being miſſed two or three days without any tidings come to his houſe of him, it was concluded by all that knew how zealous and concerned he was againſt the <hi>Petropolitan Plotters,</hi> that they had by ſome means or other murthered him; for the better Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which, the King himſelf, as well out of a <hi>Princely</hi> abhorrency of ſuch an horrid Fact, as the affection he had to this worthy <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> for the ſervices he had done him, cauſed his <hi>Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> to be iſſued out, commanding a ſtrict ſearch and enquiry to be made about it, and promiſed a great Reward to any that ſhould diſcover the murther (if any were) beſides a <hi>Pardon</hi> to the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer,</hi> if concerned in it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Alarm</hi> netled the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> to ſome purpoſe, and put them to their old ſhifts of Evaſion and diſſimulation; ſo that now they ſpread reports about the <hi>Town,</hi> that Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was gone a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into ſome remote <hi>Country,</hi> to be married to a great Lady, and took the confidence to name her.</p>

               <p>It is remarkable that his Rings, Watch, and ſome Moneys both Gold and Silver were found in his Pockets, which ſhould evidence that he was not murthered by Thieves or Robbers, but that it was done either out of revenge by ſome others, or in diſcontent by himſelf.</p>

               <p>The rumour of this Murther being quickly ſpread about the Town, drew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people to the place, out of curioſity, to ſee the murthered Body, of whom ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them that were acquainted with him in his life time, knew it to be the Body of Sir <hi>Edmond;</hi> whereupon his mournful <hi>Relations</hi> upon notice of it, took him into their Cuſtody, in order to beſtow upon him (as he deſerved, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards had) a decent and becoming Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

that had been lately executed, and being himſelf known to be a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> fearing to be called in queſtion about what he had ſaid, did therefore abſcond him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for two or three dayes from his houſe.

               <p>That they afterwards were taken by <hi>Phileroy,</hi> who being revolted from the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> had now diſcovered their Deſigns and Parties concerned in them to the King himſelf.

by reaſon of his late diſmembring at his <hi>Execution,</hi> yet a grave comely perſon to look on: upon view of his Countenance I knew him to be the <hi>Petropolitan Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> At his coming up, ſeeing them ſit in form of a <hi>Court,</hi> and that he was to be tryed before them, he began like a <hi>Lawyer</hi> to put queſtions to them, demanding of them <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> they ſate, and what <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction</hi> they claimed, and that if they had any thing there to charge him with, he had already made <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> upon an <hi>Execution</hi> executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Body, Limbs and Members, and therefore demanded the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Court, <hi>ſi ulterius implitetur,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Advocate</hi> turning his head, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>old Viccar</hi> ſitting at the other end of the <hi>Board,</hi> enquired if he were in <hi>Commiſsion</hi> as a <hi>Iudge</hi> there, or no;

                  <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> anſwered him no; he was only an <hi>Aſſociate,</hi> and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the <hi>ſole Iudge</hi> in that place, and that he muſt direct his Speech to him, which the <hi>Advocate</hi> after a formal cringe accordingly did, beginning thus.</p>

               <p>I was, while upon <hi>Earth, Advocate</hi> to the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> and retained by them at the <hi>Conſult</hi> here lately holden, to be aſſiſtant to them in their preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; purſuant to which, ſince my return into <hi>Albonia,</hi> I performed them theſe <hi>Services;</hi> as namely, by contriving Settlements of ſuch <hi>Eſtates</hi> as they had <hi>purchaſed,</hi> in ſuch Diſpoſitions as they might be ſecured of the ſame; by, holding Correſpondence with the <hi>Franconian Confeſſor;</hi> by encouraging the <hi>Deſigns</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> imployed for the killing of the <hi>King;</hi> by taking care of delivering out the Commiſſions granted by His <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carſhip</hi> to the <hi>Petropolitan Lords,</hi> and others of Places and Offices conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; by procuring 6000 <abbr>

               <p>Theſe were my ſervices, and theſe have been my ſufferings; for which I hope and expect by your <hi>gracious</hi> ſuffrages, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the honorary Fee of Martyrdom.</p>

               <p>At laſt to make up the full complement of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> were brought up the five great <hi>Worthies</hi> of the <hi>Ignatian Order,</hi> who had been the moſt <hi>active</hi> and ſtirring, in carrying on this <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> of all

none but the <hi>Spiritualty,</hi> and therefore they appealed to his <hi>Viccarſhip:</hi> Why, What the <hi>Devil</hi> do you make of me (ſayes <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi>) an <hi>Aſs,</hi> or an <hi>Hobby-horſe?</hi> I will maintain it, I am more <hi>Spiritual</hi> than you, or your <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> himſelf; And where, I wonder, lyes this precious <hi>Spirituality</hi> of yours? in the <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> imbraces of your Beloved <hi>Courtezans</hi> in the <hi>Seraphique</hi> pleaſures of delicious drinking and feeding, or in the refined morals of bloody and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous practices, ſuch as makes <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf to bluſh at you for out-doing them in wickedneſs: Well, you ſee what your <hi>Spiritual</hi> practices have brought you to; but indeed, had you been as truly <hi>Spiritual</hi> as I am, you had ſaved your ſelves a <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> and cheated the Hangman of your <hi>Quarters;</hi> but I will not be trifled with Gentlemen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to the buſineſs, and tell me plainly for what you came hither.</p>

this affair, I fancied a <hi>Deſign</hi> to walk ſometimes in the dusk of the Evening <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi> under the diſguiſe of a <hi>Petropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,</hi> with a <hi>Roſary</hi> of Beads and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix at my Girdle (the ſame that <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> had beſtowed upon me at <hi>Strom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo</hi>) to ſuch places as I knew the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> uſed to meet at, where, under this diſguiſe, I got free admittance into their companies, and underſtood their <hi>Deſigns;</hi> which notwithſtanding the late <hi>Diſcovery</hi> and Execution of the aforeſaid <hi>Traytors,</hi> I perceived they ſtill carryed on as vigorouſly as ever, only they were fain now to alter their <hi>Scenes,</hi> and to act in <hi>Maſquerade</hi> (hiding their <hi>Cloven Feet</hi>) and pretending themſelves to be <hi>Albonian Chriſtians;</hi> when if their Deſigns ſhould chance to be diſcovered, they were to charge it upon the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> it being now their chief Endeavour by <hi>Libelling</hi> in Print, by the means of ſome <hi>Bookſellers Fitz Tom Ekoot,</hi> and others (whom they had procured to ſerve them) to take off the Plot (which was now ſo much noiſed through the <hi>World</hi>) from themſelves, and to charge it upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as their ſole and proper Deſign and Practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:95381:113"/>One Night, as I was in my <hi>Fancy</hi> walking towards one of their <hi>haunts</hi> with my <hi>Beads</hi> and <hi>Crucifix</hi> dangling about me, as I uſed to appear at ſuch times, methoughts I met my old Friend <hi>Phileroy,</hi> attended with his <hi>Royal Guard</hi> about him, who, I ſuppoſe, was at his old Trade of <hi>Prieſt-hunting,</hi> ſo that I was unwilling at this time to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and therefore would have avoided him by croſſing the way; but he (by that little light that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared) perceiving the <hi>Trinkets</hi> at my Girdle, bobbing out at the waving of my <hi>upper Coat,</hi> preſently took me for a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> and thereupon ſtopped my farther motion, by laying hold on my Arm, and ſaying, Sir, you are my <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</hi> I was troubled at the <hi>Surpriſe,</hi> not that I feared <hi>Phileroy,</hi> but becauſe of his Company, that upon theſe words began to draw about me, and whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, had I been really ſuch a one as I was taken for, I ſhould have feared more than all the <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Strombolo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Phileroy</hi> was as much ſurpriſed as I, when looking nearer in my face, he perceived who I was; wherefore upon the ſudden, to make the beſt of the matter,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95381:113"/>
he gave me an Embrace, putting one hand under my Coat, with which he privately ſnatched off my <hi>Petropolitan baubles</hi> and put them in my <hi>Pocket;</hi> and then turning him to his <hi>Guard,</hi> he told them I was indeed, and muſt be his <hi>Priſoner</hi> for that night, but neither for <hi>Felony</hi> nor <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but upon the account of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> I being an old <hi>Friend</hi> of his and a good <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>God bleſs me;</hi> that if I was a <hi>Friend</hi> of his, they were ſure I was no <hi>Cnemy</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> or State, and had no more to ſay to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phileroy</hi> had finiſhed his Expeditions for this day, and was now returning to his Lodgings in the <hi>Royal Pallace,</hi> where for that night he would needs have me to bear him company, which I did pretty willingly aſſent to, that I might after a long abſence recruit my ſelf from him, of ſome farther particulars relating to the preſent <hi>Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we walked along, <hi>Phileroy</hi> whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering me in the Ear, asked me for what purpoſe I wore my Roſarie ſo openly, and whether I was in <hi>Ieſt</hi> or <hi>Earneſt.</hi> I told him I was no <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> neither in <hi>Ieſt</hi> nor <hi>Earneſt,</hi> but betwixt both, of which I
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95381:114"/>
would acquaint him farther at a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient opportunity.</p>
               <p>Being arrived with him at his <hi>Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> in the <hi>Pallace,</hi> and his Guards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, he and I ſate down ſeriouſly over a Bottle of Wine that he had ready, to diſcourſe of the paſſages that had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this now overgrown <hi>Plot</hi> ſince our laſt meeting: And firſt at his requeſt I gave him an Account of my late dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Voyage</hi> into <hi>Strombolo,</hi> and the paſſages I obſerved there in the <hi>Tryals,</hi> before <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> of the <hi>Alboni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Traytors,</hi> that I underſtood by them were here lately executed; as alſo the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts they gave in of the particular facts for which they ſuffered, asking <hi>Phileroy,</hi> he being (I perceived by them) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Witneſs that was uſed againſt them, whether their <hi>Informations</hi> were true as to the <hi>principal</hi> heads they delivered of the cauſes of their ſufferings; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me they were; but wondring withal what kind of <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> or <hi>Genius</hi> I was poſſeſſed with, that ſhould inform me ſo truly of things in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which were really acted, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subject of all mens diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>I was, ſaid <hi>Phileroy,</hi> (raiſed by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95381:114"/>
to this grateful, though hazardous office) the principal Witneſs made uſe of againſt them, which hitherto I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with that ſucceſs as has cleared the Truth, confounded their Deſigns, and brought them to exemplary puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Yet have I not managed this <hi>Province</hi> without apparent dangers and difficulties, by means of the revengeful <hi>Petropolitans</hi> Deſigns againſt me, interweaving their <hi>grand Plot</hi> againſt the <hi>State</hi> with others againſt me, (as their moſt offenſive Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) to invalidate my credit, by raiſing ſuch malicious <hi>Slanders</hi> upon me, as ſhould render me a perſon not fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or truſted.</p>
               <p>To this End they had tampered with a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> being then a <hi>Priſoner</hi> in one of our <hi>Town Gaols,</hi> and acquainted with the <hi>Petropolitan Lords,</hi> to endeavour to corrupt (with promiſes of large Summs of Mony) ſome particular perſons, named by them, to ſwear againſt me and Capt. <hi>Loved,</hi> ſuch things as ſhould be dictated to them, which were in effect to oppoſe our <hi>Evidence,</hi> to <hi>ſcandalize</hi> us with odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crimes, and to charge the <hi>Plot</hi> on the diſſenting <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as if they were the principal <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Contrivers</hi> of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95381:115"/>
it. The Name of this <hi>Prieſt</hi> was <hi>Vile-Netter</hi> a <hi>Boglander,</hi> who was influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and directed in this project by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Fraternity, who lay committed in the ſame <hi>Gaol</hi> by a ſtrange Name that he had aſſumed for his Concealment; but was indeed <hi>Dominieo,</hi> one that has been ſince diſcovered to have had an hand in the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſons they would have corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were two <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the one an <hi>Alderman,</hi> and the other a <hi>Captain</hi> in <hi>Bogland,</hi> who having ſome former acquaintance with this <hi>Vile-net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when living there, and hearing now ſince their being here, of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, went ſometimes out of civility to ſee him; to whom the crafty <hi>Prieſt,</hi> imagining their occaſions for Money, by reaſon of their Expence about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might make them greedy of the bait, did at times break his mind of the buſineſs to them ſeverally and apart, that one might not know of the others being concerned, under promiſes of great Sums of Money, if they did effectually proceed in the Deſign.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cant.</hi> (an honeſt Gentleman and a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>) abhorred the Deſign, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95381:115"/>
their Rewards; yet that he might get a farther Inſight into their Deſigns, he ſeemed to adhere, and proceeded ſo far, that he learned from whoſe hands he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Reward, and a promiſe of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be drawn up, containing the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the things he was to ſwear to, ſaying, <hi>[That if they could but turn off this Plot, there was no fear of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their buſineſs.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The honeſt <hi>Capt.</hi> from time to time made his Diſcoveries of theſe Paſſages to one of the <hi>Royal Secretaries,</hi> yet hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtill with them, till he ſhould come to find out the bottom of the <hi>Deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while we came to get a Diſcovery of <hi>Dominico,</hi> by a ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; for having wrote a Note to one of the Fraternity to come to him, and got the <hi>Alderman</hi> to deliver it, he had ſo far forgot himſelf, as to leave out his feigned name, and to ſubſcribe his true, and withal to ſend it open; by which means it became preſently known, that he was the perſon concerned in Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>'s Murther: whereupon <hi>Capt. Lobed</hi> and I, taking with us a worthy Magiſtrate that ſucceeded Sir <hi>Edmond,</hi> as well in place, as Loyal and Hearty Endeavours in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95381:116"/>
the <hi>Plotters,</hi> went to the Priſon to take an Examination of the buſineſs. But the crafty old Fox <hi>Dominico</hi> finding himſelf likely to be <hi>nooſed,</hi> had <hi>gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the Snare in two that held him, and got looſe: For having procured two fellows for 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> a piece to become bail for him, he thereby having got himſelf at large, took his Flight, and is not ſince to be heard of.</p>
               <p>The Information of theſe paſſages upon promiſe of Pardon, we got from <hi>Vile-Netter,</hi> but hereby it happened, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a farther Diſcovery, which the <hi>Boglandian</hi> Captain would have made in the buſineſs; but <hi>Vile-Netter</hi> ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had diſcovered the Deſign to us, would now treat with him no farther.</p>
               <p>Another Deſign yet more deviliſh than this hath been ſince laid againſt me, by the means of one <hi>Knoxius,</hi> a Retainer to the <hi>Grand Taſhier,</hi> who, at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſaid <hi>Caſhier,</hi> and other <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Lords,</hi> on purpoſe to hinder my Evidence againſt them, had corrupted two perſons that had been my ſervants, <hi>Bornos</hi> and <hi>Elan,</hi> by feigned Letters and Papers contrived to their hands, to defame me in the moſt horrid manner
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95381:116"/>
imaginable, charging me with vile words, that I ſhould uſe againſt the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſeveral of his <hi>Nobility;</hi> as alſo that I ſhould contrive with <hi>Capt. Lobed</hi> upon a way of ſwearing falſly againſt the <hi>Grand Caſheir;</hi> and to compleat their malice, that I ſhould attempt to commit (that not to be named ſin) ſin of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> with one of the <hi>Villains,</hi> who was ſo far <hi>Reprobate</hi> in his wickedneſs, as to ſwear it againſt me before a <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> Theſe were the batteries laid againſt me, yet I thank God my own Innocence was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Sconce</hi> to me againſt them all,

'Gainſt Slander, is a man's own Innocence.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Deſign</hi> I was well aſſured, was incouraged by the <hi>Grand Caſheir</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who upon the hopes of its ſucceeding, after having ſome time abſconded himſelf, did now venture to ſurrender himſelf up to the hands of the <hi>Senate;</hi> and the ſame day this Servant <hi>Knoxius</hi> made his Inſtruments again to ſwear to ſtand to their Information.</p>
               <p>Having now fully underſtood their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95381:117"/>
againſt me, I made my Complaint thereof to the <hi>Royal Council,</hi> who ſending for the Conſpirators, and taking their Informations; <hi>Bornos</hi> and <hi>Elan</hi> freely confeſſed that they had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned by <hi>Knoxius,</hi> who in the <hi>Grand Caſhier</hi>'s Name, promiſed them great Rewards to ſwear againſt me and <hi>Captain Lobed;</hi> dropping a Guinney to them in Earneſt, and maintaining them with Meat, Drink, and Lodging for their Service; that to oblige them the more, he had given them the <hi>Oaths of Secrecy,</hi> and ſwore, they ſhould be killed if they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcover. But now they freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the falſity of thoſe things they were to ſwear againſt me, and gave ſufficient proof of my <hi>Innocency,</hi> and how I had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my ſelf while they were my Servants.</p>
               <p>Yet they being for ſome time retained in Priſon upon this matter, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tampered with again by ſome new Agents of the <hi>Petropolitan Lords</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive their Evidence upon review and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made in the former Papers; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to which curſed <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> they firſt made means to diſcharge them of their Impriſonment, and then taking them into their own keepings, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

or to ſay nothing to the purpoſe, when he ſhould be called as a <hi>Witneſs</hi> againſt them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inſtrument</hi> they imployed in this Affair was an <hi>Advocate</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> a great Friend to their <hi>Party,</hi> and one that did buſineſs for many of them, and amongſt the reſt, ſome of the <hi>Petropolitan Lords;</hi> on whoſe behalf, and by them, he was engaged thus to tamper with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Lobed,</hi> with free expreſſions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for the preſent, and large promiſes of future Rewards, if he ſhould herein effectually ſerve them.</p>

at laſt he proceeds (the <hi>Devils</hi> uſual method) to Menaces; threatning, That if he would not ſerve them at home, a <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> was ready, which ſhould tranſport him far enough from doing any ſervice againſt them.

               <p>But to proceed with my <hi>Narrative;</hi> There was one other of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> or <hi>Diſcoverers,</hi> that came not off ſo happily with them as I and <hi>Captain Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi> did; one <hi>Darever</hi> a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> by Birth a <hi>Scote-britain,</hi> who being in <hi>Franconia</hi> at the time when our Noble <hi>Cambrian Duke</hi> (the Flower of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry</hi> at this day) commanded the <hi>Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Forces that were ſent over to aſſiſt that <hi>King</hi> in his Wars.

               <p>
                  <hi>Darever</hi> being now acquainted with their treaſonable <hi>Deſigns,</hi> to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was a Stranger, diſcovered the ſame to an <hi>Albonian</hi> Knight then at the Court, for his aſſiſtance to communicate it to the <hi>King of Albonia;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the matter to a Brother of the <hi>titular Biſhops,</hi> a <hi>Petropolitan,</hi> and <hi>Colonel</hi> in the Army, and of <hi>Darevers</hi> intention to diſcover it at his return to

                  <hi>Albonia;</hi> the <hi>Colonel</hi> and his Party hereupon threatned him, that if he ever attempted ſuch a thing, he ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly committed to the <hi>Great Tower</hi> at <hi>Londinopolis,</hi> or ſome other Priſon, by their Procurement.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Loyal Gentleman (though with much difficulty) eſcaping their revengeful hands, got ſafe into <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonia,</hi> where he intended to acquaint the <hi>Cambrian Duke,</hi> who is eſteemed a great Enemy to the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> and was now likewiſe returned from <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> with this Deſign, but before he could get an opportunity to ſpeak with him, the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> had made their intereſt at Court againſt him: whereupon being had up before one of the Royal <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries,</hi> he was without any Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or proof of any crime againſt him, ſent to the <hi>Great Tower,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Moneths ſtay, he was examined by the Lieutenant of that place, to whom he diſcovered what he intended to have ſaid to the <hi>Cambrian Duke</hi> concerning this Deſign.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95381:123"/>
became ſo ſavage in his looks, overgrown with hair; and mean in apparel, that they that were acquainted with him before, could now hardly know him.</p>
               <p>But from theſe miſeries, he was at laſt releaſed by the happy Convention of the <hi>Albonian Senate.</hi> The two <hi>Grand Eſtates</hi> thereof, being both informed of their Proceedings againſt him, and his Sufferings, did take upon them the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the buſineſs, and being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently made ſenſible of his innocency, and the wrongs done him, did obtain of his Majeſty a diſcharge for him: and he hath ſince his releaſement, been very inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in making farther <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> of this preſent <hi>Plot.</hi>

               <p>One more inſtance I ſhall give you (ſaid <hi>Phileroy</hi>) of another Witneſs, whom God raiſed to confirm the truth of this <hi>Plot,</hi> one <hi>Fitz-Ienny</hi> a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of good Extract and Quality; but himſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily all <hi>Petropolitans.</hi> And though the Principles of that Religion, in which he had been educated from his Childhood, did ingage him to the Intereſt of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet he had ſo much reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet left untainted in him, as to ſee into the horrid wickedneſs of rheir Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95381:124"/>
and ſo deſigned to leave them, and make a Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>But this was not to be done without the difficulty of loſing his <hi>Relations,</hi> who, as I ſaid, were all <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> (beſides what advantages, as to his Eſtate, he might expect by them) <hi>Bogland,</hi> one of the two Prieſts that were lately executed for conſpiring againſt the Life of the King, was his near <hi>Kinſman,</hi> and his <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> a perſon deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the preſent Plot, for which he was after put into the <hi>Den of Thieves,</hi> about the time that this <hi>Fitz-Ienny</hi> was about to make his Diſcovery. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> grounded this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious report of him, that he had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would proſecute his <hi>Brother</hi> meerly to get the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the Eſtate from him, by incapacitating him to enjoy it. But the Vanity of this <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> he eaſily made out, by his generous declining all ſuch <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> advantages, in that he would not deliver in his <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> till ſuch time as he got a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, from the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Royal Council</hi> to obtain the <hi>Kings Pardon</hi> for his ſaid Brother.</p>
               <p>His Kinſman <hi>Bogland</hi> did, both at his

                  <hi>Trial</hi> and at his <hi>Death,</hi> like (a true <hi>Petropolitan</hi>) deny a neceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Evidence againſt him, which was material to his Conviction, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was at <hi>Londinopolis</hi> upon <hi>ſuch</hi> a day acting in the <hi>Deſign,</hi> when at the <hi>ſame</hi> time he affirmed with ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations that he was remote off in the Country. This Circumſtance for a time, the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> did much glory in. But this his <hi>Kinſman Fitz-Ienny</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the matter, being called upon to atteſt the ſame at the <hi>Trial</hi> of ſome other <hi>Prieſts</hi> afterwards, did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly declare that he was with the ſaid <hi>Bogland</hi> at the ſame time mentioned in the Evidence, at <hi>Londinopolis,</hi> by which means the truth of that particular was cleared, and the <hi>Petropolitans</hi> defeated of their deſign.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This was the firſt proof of the integrity of this worthy <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> after which he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95381:125"/>
proceeded to diſcover ſeveral other of their Practices, both at home and abroad, as namely, that being at <hi>Petropolis,</hi> he heard the <hi>Ignatians</hi> affirm, as a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of their Religion, that the <hi>Grand Viccar</hi> had Power to depoſe <hi>Kings;</hi> and that <hi>Princes</hi> being by him once excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate (which in their ſenſe is not only to <hi>Vn-chriſtian</hi> them, but to <hi>Vn-king</hi> them) it is not only a thing <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>meritorious</hi> for their <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> them.</p>
               <p>And by the way (ſaid <hi>Phileroy</hi>) this Doctrine of theirs (known to be allowed and approved by them in their moſt <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique</hi> writings) may ſerve to un-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that myſterious <hi>Salvo,</hi> ſo <hi>formally</hi> uſed by them in their <hi>dying Speeches,</hi> and by which the <hi>over-credulous</hi> Vulgar are ſo eaſily amuſed into a perſuaſion of their Innocency <hi>viz. <hi>[That they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of any Deſign or Endeavour to kill the King.]</hi>
                  </hi> For according to this Doctrine, and in their <hi>Petropolitan</hi> ſenſe, Our <hi>King</hi> is no <hi>King,</hi> being deprived both of <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> by the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Chair.</hi>

               <p>But to return to our matter; this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Fitz-Ienny</hi> being more true to his

               <p>It was no ſmall temptation to this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> that during this while he was continually <hi>attacqued</hi> by the moſt <hi>paſsionate</hi> and <hi>importunate</hi> Letters of his neareſt <hi>Relations,</hi> urging him as a <hi>Rebel</hi> to his own <hi>Blood,</hi> with the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi> of bringing a certain ruine upon his

whole <hi>family,</hi> if he went on in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; but theſe powerful <hi>Suada's</hi> had ſo little <hi>Influence</hi> upon the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> of his mind, and <hi>prevailed</hi> no more to <hi>reduce</hi> him to his former (but now aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned) <hi>Principles,</hi> (the thing they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aimed) than that they produced the quite contrary effects, both to confirm him in his Reſolutions; and the Conſideration thereof, together with the Conviction of the (now clearly detected) <hi>Villany</hi> of that <hi>Party</hi> whoſe profeſſion he had own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did ſo far prevail with his aged <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that (abjuring his own) he became a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and farther, to make the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> and the truth more illuſtrious, he gained another Convert out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Family, a Secular Prieſt, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer to it in that Office, who, by this means, was taken from performing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip in a private Family, to the ſervice of (more than one <hi>Tribe</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>

               <p>YEt now it comes into my mind, I will, (before I leave this Subject) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with another help they had at a <hi>dead lift,</hi> to aſſiſt them in baffling our Evidence. You know we heard when we were at <hi>Strombolo,</hi> that <hi>St. Omers</hi> in <hi>Franconia</hi> was aſſigned them as the chief place of Rendezvous: and alſo for a Colledge or Nurſery for training up their young <hi>Frie,</hi> and <hi>inſtructing</hi> them in the <hi>ſacred myſteries</hi> of <hi>King-killing</hi> and deſtruction of States and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Here a Party of them have kept their <hi>Conſults,</hi> and hence as occaſion hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they have from time to time ſent over Supplies to their <hi>Correſpondents</hi> in <hi>Albonia,</hi> in which Negotiations I and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Lobed</hi> have ſeveral times been ſent over thither, while we were of their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95381:128"/>
Party, and there the Younkers got ſome acquaintance with us, which their Friends here have made an opportunity now of a Deſign againſt us. For the <hi>Old Foxes</hi> having had ſo bad <hi>Succeſs</hi> in following their Game that they were continually taken in our Toils, and defeated of their prey. Not knowing which way better to help themſelves, they ſent over to <hi>St. Omers</hi> for a <hi>Litter</hi> of thoſe <hi>Cubs,</hi> that by this time had been ſo well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Game, that they could follow the ſcent of Bloud, and imitate the <hi>Old Reynards</hi> in their wily ways of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Equivocation</hi> pretty dextrouſly. No ſooner was this <hi>Litter</hi> come over, but their <hi>Game</hi> was ſhewed them, <hi>I it</hi> was that they were to worry. Indeed I had got ſome of the <hi>Old Foxes</hi> in a <hi>Noole (Blancpain</hi> and the reſt of his Gang, being now upon their <hi>Trial</hi>) and theſe young <hi>Cubs</hi> were to gnaw aſunder the Cord (if they could) to unſnare them, that is, to thwart and contradict my Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I had ſworn that I was preſent in the Moneth of <hi>April</hi> at a <hi>Conſult in Londinopolis;</hi> their Leſſon was, that I was then, and ſome Moneths after with them at <hi>St. Omers;</hi> yet they had not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95381:129"/>
ſo well conned their <hi>Leſſon,</hi> but when came to ſay it, they faltred pitifully.</p>
               <p>And though they opened wide and yelped amain, yet all was little to the purpoſe; for it was perceived, that while they built the <hi>Babel</hi> of a mighty confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon theſe <hi>Younkers</hi> undertaking, they had ſent amongſt them the <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Tongues,</hi> ſo that <hi>Hammer</hi> and <hi>Morter</hi> were there as <hi>relative</hi> to one purpoſe, as their Evidences one to another: For ſome of them would make me to leave <hi>St. Omers</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> others would have me not to leave it till <hi>Iune,</hi> but one Gentleman, whoſe <hi>tongue</hi> had got the ſtart of his <hi>wit,</hi> retched it as far as <hi>Iuly,</hi> which the <hi>Court</hi> taking notice of, told him that his Evidence was wide of all the reſt, who agreed upon either the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Iune.</hi> But to help the matter, he told them, <hi>if he failed in any thing as to the punctuality of the time, yet he was ſure I ſtaid at St. Omers till the Conſult was over.</hi> This was the Mark they aimed at, (ſhoot high or low) to prove that I was not at the Conſult at the time I alledged, and ſo could not be a Witneſs of what paſſed there. But this
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95381:129"/>
confident Lad, though he and the reſt had miſtook their Proofs, yet he remembred the Text, to prove that I was not at the Conſult, for he was ſure, (right or wrong, when or when not) that I ſtaid at <hi>St. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> till the ſame was over. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this paſſage cauſed ſome laughter in the <hi>Court,</hi> but more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them; when after theſe <hi>Whelps</hi> had done mouthing their idle tales and falſhoods) I brought in ſix or ſeven credible Witneſſes to make good my own Allegation, that I was all the Moneth of <hi>April</hi> here in Town. This, as it was full ſatisfaction to the <hi>Iudge</hi> and Jury, ſo it proved ſuch a defeat to the <hi>Younkers,</hi> that upon the diſcouragement thereof, they have not ſince appeared ſo publickly to <hi>confront Evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſtill privately they endeavour (if poſſible) to corrupt them, as lately one <hi>Dagdule</hi> a Witneſs lately come in againſt them, having publiſhed his Informations of their Practices, they procured a man and a woman with proffers of great and certain Rewards, to tempt him to retract what he had ſaid or written; and had drawn up a Paper ready for him to ſign to, to that purpoſe. But though out of a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95381:130"/>
deſign to trie how far they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with him, he kept them for ſome time in ſuſpenſe about it; yet in that time having acquainted ſome <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> with it, he (by Virtue of their Warrant) took a convenient opportunity to ſeize them, and hath laid them both in <hi>Priſon</hi> till ſuch time as they ſhall be called to their <hi>Trial</hi> to anſwer for their <hi>Subornation.</hi> This hath been the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (and no better) that they have hitherto met with in tampering with our <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and this hath made the Wheels of their Motion to go on ſo heavily hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. And may they never move <hi>ſwiftlier</hi> till they be overwhelmed with the <hi>torrents</hi> of a deſerved <hi>Vengeance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phileroy</hi> having given me theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Witneſſes, which were very pleaſing and ſatisfactory to me, I deſired him (having firſt drank a Glaſs of Wine to recruit his Spirits) to inform me of ſome other matters relating to the Plot, as they ſhould come into his mind, for that all late <hi>paſſages</hi> were <hi>News</hi> to me, being come over ſo lately from <hi>Strom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo. Phileroy</hi> told me, that in a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> ſo confuſed, and that tended to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confuſion, as this did, it was
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95381:130"/>
impoſſible for him to obſerve any order or method, in his Diſcourſes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would rather I would hint to him what matters I would deſire to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, and he would give me the beſt ſatisfaction he could about them.</p>
               <p>I thanked him for the kindneſs, and the firſt thing I deſired him to ſatisfie me in, was about the <hi>Devils Drugſter,</hi> the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> that was imployed to poiſon the <hi>King,</hi> whether ſince his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had been brought to his Trial. <hi>Phileroy</hi> informed me, that he had; together with two <hi>Benedictine Monks</hi> and a <hi>Lay-Brother</hi> of that Order, who were all tried before the <hi>Supreme Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of the <hi>Kings Court.</hi> But (ſaid <hi>Phileroy</hi>) although I then ſufficiently proved what I told you I had formerly charged him with before the <hi>Royal Council,</hi> of his being hired to <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>King</hi> by a Letter which I proved to be of his own hand-writing, by a Note en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their <hi>Regiſtry,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Rector of Londinopolis Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har</hi>'s own hand, of his acceptance of 15000 <abbr>l.</abbr> for that Service. And although it was farther proved by <hi>Captain Lobed</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Courthar</hi> at one time gave
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95381:131"/>
him a Bill for the receipt of 2000 <abbr>l.</abbr> in part of payment; and at the <hi>ſame time</hi> that the <hi>Phyſician</hi> ſhould declare that <hi>the buſineſs muſt be cloſely followed, and that if they ſhould miſs doing of it in one place, they muſt do it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> yet notwithſtanding all this <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> the <hi>Twelve Men</hi> (who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Albonian</hi> Laws, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges of matters of Fact) brought in a Verdict for him of <hi>Not guilty;</hi> and did the like by the other four that were tried with him, though it was apparently proved that they were all <hi>Abettors of the Plot,</hi> and conſented to the giving of 6000 <abbr>l.</abbr> for the carrying of it on, to be raiſed out of the Stock of their Society; notwithſtanding which, they alſo were brought in <hi>Not guilty;</hi> ſo they were all acquitted. It is thought that the Purſe of Gold that the <hi>Phyſician</hi> received from the <hi>Grand Viccar,</hi> had ſo ſtrong a Charm in it, as to render him invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt any penalties of Law or Juſtice.</p>

               <p>They have ſince carried on the <hi>Deſign as hotly</hi> as before, by firing ſeveral other <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi> in <hi>Albonia,</hi> and particularly lately a great part of a famous and populous <hi>Burrough</hi> on the South ſide of <hi>Londinopolis.</hi>

               <p>I perceived after theſe long Diſcourſes, that <hi>Phileroy</hi> began to be heavy-eyed, and ſo (methoughts) for all I was ſleeping and dreaming all this while, I was too; but my <hi>Fanſic</hi> did ſo violently work upon theſe matters, that I could not reſt till I were ſatisfied in one thing more; which was, how matters ſtood with the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Lords,</hi> who I underſtood by <hi>Phileroy,</hi> were now impriſoned in the <hi>Royal Tower.</hi> I deſired him onely to give me ſome ſhort accounts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt them, and then I would give him no farther trouble at this time. <hi>Phileroy</hi> willing to gratifie my curioſity to the utmoſt (rubbing his eyes a little) began thus:</p>
               <p>I have already, ſaid <hi>Phileroy,</hi> in ſome of my former Diſcourſes with you about theſe matters, acquainted you how theſe <hi>five Lords</hi> came to be drawn into the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the nature of their Crimes; which as they are complicated together, would be tedious to recite to you. But for theſe Crimes being impriſoned in the <hi>Royal Tower,</hi> they had afterwards an
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95381:133"/>
Impeachment drawn up againſt them by the <hi>Lower Senate,</hi> conſiſting (as you know) of the Commonalty of the whole Kingdom, wherein they were ſeverally charged with <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> for conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the <hi>Secretary</hi> and the other <hi>Traitors</hi> (whoſe Facts and Trials have been already mentioned) to ſubvert the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and introducing <hi>Petropolitaniſm,</hi> to <hi>murther</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> to alienate our Eſtates, to ſeize our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, to introduce foreign Arms, and to that end receiving <hi>Commiſsions</hi> of Places and Offices by allowing <hi>Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> out of their Eſtates to carry on the Deſigns of their <hi>Treaſon,</hi> with ſeveral other particulars, too tedious to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; which <hi>Impeachment,</hi> according to cuſtom, was carried up to the <hi>Senate of Lords,</hi> before whom the matters therein charged were to be tried.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Impeachment,</hi> the ſaid <hi>five Lords</hi> being called upon to give in their Anſwer, made a <hi>Demurr,</hi> (a Phraſe you know uſed in their <hi>Forms</hi> by our <hi>Lawyers</hi> in <hi>Albonia</hi>) which they gave in in Writing; for that the Facts alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Impeachment, were ſo general, and the times and places (wherein they

                  <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> and thereupon without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcruple (telling me he was glad to ſee me) he took me by the hand, and drew me into the <hi>Houſe,</hi> telling me by the way, that we ſhould now underſtand the Reſults of their <hi>Sham-Plot.</hi> I durſt not preſume to ask him what <hi>Sham</hi> he meant, leſt I ſhould appear to be as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as indeed I was, and ſo incur a new ſuſpicion; but told him, I longed my ſelf very much to underſtand the Conſequence of it.

white, like <hi>Meal</hi> or <hi>Flower;</hi> I concluded this was the Reaſon they were ſo <hi>mealy Mouthed:</hi> And in the midſt of the company I perceived a <hi>Tub</hi> of <hi>Meal</hi> ſtanding, but what the conceit of it ſhould be I knew not, except it were ſome <hi>Griſt</hi> of the <hi>Seminaries</hi> grain, prepared to ſend over to <hi>Petropolis</hi> to make <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk Dumplings</hi> for the <hi>Albonian Cardinal;</hi> I underſtood nothing of their <hi>Deſign</hi> by all this, and durſt not ask queſtions for fear of being ſuſpected for a <hi>Novice</hi> or <hi>Intruder:</hi> But my <hi>old Mate</hi> that introduced me, gave me ſome light by the queſtion, that I overheard, put to one of the Company, to whom he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, asking him what was become of the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Model</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and whether there had been any <hi>Diſcove</hi>-to whom the other replied, yes, and that the whole Deſign was diſcovered by means of that <hi>Apoſtate, Renegade Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> who violating his <hi>Truſt,</hi> had diſcloſed the whole <hi>Deſign</hi> to the <hi>Londinopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Magiſtrates; and for the <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Papers</hi> wherein the <hi>Model</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> was contained, and were hid in the <hi>Meal-Tub</hi> there before them for more ſecurity; the ſame (upon ſome unhappy

one upon another, as whiſt as <hi>Mice,</hi> until their unſociable ſilence began to make their company weariſom to each other, ſo that ſome of them beginning to riſe up, the reſt did the ſame; and having made their complements to the <hi>Midwife,</hi> who I perceived was Miſtriſs of that houſe, they then took leave one of another, and departed to their ſeveral quarters; only I and my Companion, who called himſelf <hi>Ovipellu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, methoughts, I was very unwilling to part company with him, till I had got from him ſome farther Informations of this preſent <hi>Deſign.</hi> As we paſſed the Streets I perceived a <hi>Tavern</hi> on the other ſide of the way, into which I invited my <hi>Strombolian</hi> to accompany me, that we might drink a <hi>condoling</hi> cup, and waſh away our <hi>Sorrows;</hi> he eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted my offer, and we went in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it was as I remember at the <hi>Myter</hi> near to the St. <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> a houſe much frequented by the <hi>Petropolitans;</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſuſpicion, <hi>Ovipellupus</hi> (as the reſt did) had left his <hi>Sham-Cloak</hi> at the <hi>houſe</hi> we came from, and now appeared in <hi>querpo</hi> like a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the <hi>Town:</hi> I had alſo put my <hi>Bead-banbles</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:95381:138"/>
into my pocket, that I might be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected as he; being fixed in a room to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I contrived with my ſelf how I ſhould do to <hi>pump</hi> him, I perceived he had no miſtruſt of me, that I was other than I pretended, and therefore I was fain to carry my ſelf accordingly, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a very ſolemn <hi>groan</hi> as he did; but on my part nothing in the Earth could be ever more feigned, telling him how deeply I reſented the miſcarriage of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> that had been ſo carefully managed; <hi>Carefully</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ovipellupus</hi>) no, there you are miſtaken, had it been ſo carefully managed as it ought, it had never miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: But a pox upon that Rogue <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peril,</hi> had not he plaid the knave with us all had been well; but we may thank our ſelves for admitting ſuch <hi>Knaves</hi> into our <hi>Society;</hi> (and I wonder) thought I with my ſelf, were all ſuch removed from you, what a <hi>mighty</hi> Number there would be of you.</p>
               <p>I tell thee <hi>Brother</hi> (ſaid he) we have a Company of <hi>Traitors</hi> amongſt us, (true ſtill thought I) that lie lurking for opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to betray us: I fear ſo too, ſaid I, but we muſt be the more wary for the future whom we truſt; for my part I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95381:138"/>
afraid that this <hi>Camperil</hi> would prove treacherous. It is proved too true, replied he, and the old <hi>proverb</hi> is made good in him; that tells you, <hi>[Save a Chief from the Gallows, and he will cut your throat if he can.]</hi> I will maintain it, we had better have gone to <hi>Hell</hi> for an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> to have ſerved us, than to have robbed the <hi>Goal</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Rogue</hi> as he is. It was mighty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me to hear the <hi>Religious Knave</hi> ſpeak the truth ſo ingeniouſly, out of a Deſign to rail down the Honeſty of a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he proceeded farther, he would needs know of me what my <hi>Office</hi> or Imployment was; I told him, I was a <hi>Maſquerader</hi> (or <hi>Brumingham,</hi> as the moderate term is uſed) for that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That is an Imployment, ſaid he, much like to mine; (nothing thought I, but honeſty makes the difference.) But being earneſt to enter upon my enquiry into this <hi>buſineſs,</hi> I could not tell which way better to excuſe my ignorance, and to get an Information from him, than to acquaint him, that though I underſtood the Deſign in general, yet as to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I was a Stranger, having been for
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95381:139"/>
ſome time abſent from <hi>Albonia,</hi> in parts beyond the Seas. He asked me what Parts? I told him <hi>Strombolo,</hi> at a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Court of <hi>Aſſize</hi> there holden by the <hi>Sieur Rhadamanthus.</hi> His next Queſtion was, Whether any of our Friends were tried there? I told him, Yes, and named ſeveral, as <hi>Blancpain, Courthar, Wickfen,</hi> &amp;c. all which were (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the merit of their Services) by the <hi>Iudges</hi> Sentence committed to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> With that, fetching an heavy figh, he replied, That he was afraid the <hi>Grand Vicar</hi> had deluded them all; and that that would be the place they ſhould all go to. But, ſaid he, rather than I will be <hi>hanged</hi> up like a <hi>Dog</hi> for my <hi>Services,</hi> and then be roaſted in <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> after that, I am almoſt in the mind to trie to get to <hi>Heaven</hi> the <hi>new</hi> way, and turn <hi>Renegade</hi> my ſelf. I told him that would be his ſureſt courſe, and mine too, for that there was but little dependance to be had upon the <hi>Grand Viccar,</hi> I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf heard him declare, that his <hi>Clavis Coeli</hi> was become uſeleſs, for that the <hi>Wards</hi> of the <hi>Locks</hi> had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince this Plot was deſigned, which I preſumed was upon ſome diſtaſte taken
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95381:139"/>
in Heaven at it. I hoped by this diſcourſe of mine, that I ſhould fetch the <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Rebellion</hi> out of him; but in the mean while, I deſired him to give me ſome ſhort account of their late proceedings; which he did with the <hi>Exordium</hi> of an

               <p>You are not ignorant, ſaid he to me, what proviſions the <hi>Deſigners</hi> of this <hi>Plot</hi> have made in caſe of <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> by <hi>ſhamming</hi> off our <hi>Deſigns</hi> upon the <hi>diſſenting</hi> Parties of the <hi>Albonian Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> and to ſet up them for the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals in our own room. And having been of late ſo often detected by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade Diſcoverers, we thought it high time to ſet our Deſigns on foot.</p>
               <p>To this end we acquainted ſome of the <hi>Petropolitan Lords</hi> (now in the <hi>Royal Tower</hi>) with our intentions, who have ſince their reſtraint been ſerviceable to us in many of our deſignments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Inſtrument</hi> we pitched upon as moſt fit for our purpoſe, was this <hi>Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade Camperil,</hi> a perſon (though of broken Fortunes, yet) of ingenious parts,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95381:140"/>
a ſubtle head, and profligate enough to attempt any <hi>Villany</hi> he ſhould be put on.</p>
               <p>Our Deſign was broke to him by the <hi>Midwife,</hi> at whoſe houſe you found us, the Wife of a <hi>Franconian</hi> Merchant, and ſo zealous a Votary to the <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Religion, that ſhe declared a courage and reſolution beyond what is uſual in her Sex, in all her actings. This perſon was a great Confident of the Lady <hi>Wiſpo</hi>'s, Wife to one of the <hi>Petropolitan Lords,</hi> and as zealous in this Cauſe as her ſelf. By whoſe advice and aſſiſtance, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Camperil,</hi> after ſome petty trials had of his abilities, was imployed in the Service.</p>
               <p>He was then a Priſoner in the <hi>Den of Thieves,</hi> but upon confidence of the great Services that (when at large) he might do them, the <hi>Midwife</hi> procured his Liberty; and when afterwards he was again clapt up in the <hi>Debtors priſon</hi> for Debt, ſhe got him removed into the <hi>Royal priſon,</hi> where he enjoyed more liberty, and allowed him 20 <abbr>s.</abbr> a Week for his maintenance. In this place he was imployed to trappan ſome <hi>Priſoners</hi> by hard drinking, to get ſomething out of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95381:140"/>
them againſt <hi>Captain Lobed,</hi> which came to nothing; but finding him dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in his attempts, they reſolved to free him, that he might be wholly at their devotion; when having compounded his Debts for 700 <abbr>l.</abbr> The <hi>Midwife</hi> paid down the money for him, and ſo diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him out of Priſon. And upon his releaſe, he is by her brought acquainted with the Lady <hi>Wiſpo,</hi> who well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him, provides him Lodging and Money, with promiſes to raiſe his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Then acquaints him with the Lord <hi>Maincaſtle,</hi> who likewiſe approves him.</p>
               <p>Then they imploy him to get ſome <hi>Petropolitan Prieſts</hi> diſcharged out of Priſon.</p>
               <p>After that, he is ſent by the Lady <hi>Wiſpo</hi> with a Pacquet to a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in the <hi>Country,</hi> from whom he receives back ſome <hi>Papers,</hi> which he was to deliver to the ſaid <hi>Lady</hi> containing the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the preſent <hi>Plot, That Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets ſhould be writ, and perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in places of publique Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to rail againſt the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Albonian Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some other Services in which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by them, before they engaged him in this <hi>Plot,</hi> were namely theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:95381:141"/>To be Tutor under the Lord <hi>Mainca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> (who was their Grand <hi>Inſtructor</hi>) to the <hi>Youths</hi> of <hi>St. Omers,</hi> who were for ſome time kept in cloſe Pickle in the Midwifes houſe, ready for uſe when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould require.</p>
               <p>To get two Villains, <hi>Knoxius</hi> and <hi>Elan</hi> diſcharged out of Priſon, and to corrupt them to ſwear falſe matters againſt <hi>Phileroy,</hi> the <hi>Renegade</hi> and <hi>Grand Enemy</hi> to our Party, namely <hi>Sodomy</hi> and <hi>Buggery.</hi> But this Deſign would not take, but <hi>Phileroy,</hi> after a Legal Trial, was acquitted.</p>
               <p>He was farther to write ſome Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and diſpoſe others in the moſt <hi>publique Coffee-houſes</hi> and places of Entertainment, tending to raiſe <hi>Sedition</hi> amongſt the <hi>People,</hi> and eſpecially to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe them againſt the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> And beſides this, he is imployed in tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Letters, and forty Liſts of the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi> each Liſt containing above 800 Names: which were privately to be diſperſed by our Agents all over <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonia,</hi> in the houſes of the <hi>Chriſtian Diſſenters,</hi> and then <hi>Searches</hi> were afterwards to be made in thoſe houſes upon other pretences; and upon finding
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95381:141"/>
theſe dangerous Papers, the <hi>Maſters</hi> of thoſe houſes were to be ſeized for <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is afterwards ſent for to one of the <hi>Petropolitan Lords</hi> in the <hi>Royal Tower,</hi> and by him tampered with for a great reward to <hi>kill the King.</hi> But this he not having courage enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, he was then (for the reward of 500 <abbr>l.</abbr>) put upon killing the little <hi>Earl Anthony,</hi> a great Enemy to our Party; but this Deſign, though he undertook, yet never effected.</p>

               <p>WHile I was mumbling over theſe lines (as they came into my mind) ſoftly to my ſelf, I perceived by the fixing of his eyes upon me, that my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion</hi> took notice of it; wherefore to blind the matter, I fell a ratling over my <hi>Beads,</hi> that he might think I was at my <hi>prayers,</hi> which put him into the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; ſo that he began alſo to jumble his <hi>Trumpery,</hi> and mutter over his <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters</hi> very devoutly.

               </p>
               <p>Our Inſtrument <hi>Camperil,</hi> having, as I told you before, prepared the way to our <hi>deſign</hi> by ſcattering ſeditious Papers abroad in the name of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> was now (for the perfecting of it) intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the <hi>Great Duke,</hi> to whom (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Model of the Deſign) he related the names of ſeveral of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nobility</hi> (the <hi>Cambrian Duke</hi> being one) that ſhould be concerned in this preſent Plot.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Great Duke</hi> having rewarded him for his Diſcovery, brought him to the <hi>King,</hi> to whom he gave in the ſame account, and had by his Majeſty 40 <abbr>l.</abbr> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him for a gratuity; after which he ſent a Letter to the <hi>K.</hi> (being at one of his Country Pallaces) with another Wheedle, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> held a great corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with his Enemies of <hi>Belgia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while the management was carried on well, and all things promiſed fair; there was now no more to do but to make an actual Diſcovery of the <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Officers</hi> ſuſpected nothing of <hi>Plats</hi> or <hi>Treaſons,</hi> but being buſie in their <hi>Search,</hi> and <hi>Camperil</hi> pretending to be as buſie as they in ranſacking the Rooms, finds out (what he need not have looked for) the <hi>treaſonable</hi> Papers in the place where he left them, and then makes a hideous out-cry of <hi>Treaſon.</hi>

The Officers being to ſearch for Goods, and not for Treaſons, take the Papers for the prohibited Goods, and carry them to their <hi>Office.</hi>

that there has been a great noiſe made, for ſome time, of another <hi>Plot</hi> like to this (if not the ſame) carried on by the <hi>Petropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans</hi> in <hi>Bogland,</hi> to kill the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of that place, to <hi>maſſacre</hi> the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and to cauſe an <hi>Invaſion</hi> of that <hi>Country</hi> by the <hi>Franconians;</hi> ſeveral Perſons have been ſeized upon this account, and Informations given to the <hi>Royal Council</hi> by Witneſſes that have come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from that place to give in Evidence againſt them, who have fully proved the truth of the ſaid <hi>Plot;</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> according to their old wont, have endeavoured ſeveral ways to <hi>Shain</hi> it off upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> tho without effect.</p>
               <p>Amongſt others that have been ſeized for this <hi>Plot,</hi> there was one <hi>Fitzar</hi> noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly concerned in it, and now a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner</hi> in the <hi>Royal Tower,</hi> who ('tis ſaid) hath, ſince his being there, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered things of ſuch a dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſome <hi>great</hi> Perſons, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been made to prevent his farther Proceedings on that kind, by bringing him to <hi>ſpeedy Iuſtice,</hi> to which end they have obtained the <hi>Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi> for the trying him by <hi>Iudges</hi> therein ſpecially deputed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:95381:149"/>But the <hi>Lower Senate</hi> having now notice of it, have endeavoured to prevent that Proceeding by having the matter brought to be examined before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to that end have preferred an Impeachment againſt him in the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> before whom he appears to ſtand now chargeable.</p>
               <p>And this way of proceeding appearing, as it were, deſigned to prevent the other, it is much feared, may occaſion ſuch <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings</hi> as may cauſe the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of the <hi>Seſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And according as <hi>Phileroy</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticated, it unhappily fell out. For within a little time after, I perceived the bright <hi>Glory</hi> that had for ſome days made this place <hi>Illuſtrious,</hi> to ſet in a <hi>black</hi> Cloud of Grief and Amazement; eſpecially to the Townſmen of <hi>Minerva</hi>'s <hi>City.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> being diſſolved, and the <hi>Senators</hi> all in a buſſle preparing for a departure, my nimble <hi>Genius</hi> out ſtript the greateſt haſt they could make, and lodged me again in fanſie at <hi>Londinopolis,</hi> before any of them could be one foot on the Road towards it.</p>

                  <l>Thought I a place, then I was ſtraightways there.</l>
               </q>
               <p>We had been ſo long <hi>dreaming</hi> over this <hi>Plot</hi> with long Halts and Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that I perceived many of our Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fanſied their apprehenſions of it to be no other than a <hi>Dream</hi> indeed. So that, methoughts, I have been fain (when I have been in company with ſuch) to pinch them hard, and rub their eyes for them, to make them believe themſelves to be awake.</p>
               <p>Yet one paſſage, ſuddenly after this late <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> brake out with ſo great a noiſe, as made our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to <hi>open</hi> their Eyes indeed, and look about them; being a new <hi>Diſcovery</hi> made out to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of the <hi>Original action</hi> in this <hi>multiform-Plot</hi> the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Circumſtances of which, as I had them from <hi>Phileroy,</hi> and the laſt Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that I ever had from him, were theſe:</p>
               <p>Since the diſſolution of the laſt <hi>Senate, Fitzar</hi> was brought before the Judges
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:95381:151"/>
of the <hi>Kings Great Tribunal,</hi> to be there tried for his <hi>Treaſons,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to own the <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> of that <hi>Court,</hi> as ſtanding impeached in the <hi>Great Senate,</hi> who were a <hi>Superiour Iuriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Plea of his (though ſtrongly urged) by his <hi>Advocates</hi>) was over-ruled by the <hi>Iudges,</hi> who affirmed their own <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi> and ſo proceeded to trie him, and cauſed him to anſwer in <hi>Court</hi> to the <hi>Charge</hi> againſt him.</p>
               <p>Which having done <hi>Fitzar</hi> requeſted of the <hi>Iudges</hi> that he might be examined by ſome of them in private concerning ſome matters that he had to reveal to them of this <hi>Plot.</hi> This his requeſt they granted, and thereupon <hi>Fitzar</hi> informed them that he had been one concerned in or at leaſt acquainted with the <hi>Murther</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmond;</hi> and that beſides other perſons, the <hi>Grand Caſhier</hi> himſelf was a Party concerned in it.</p>
               <p>And having taken his <hi>Oath</hi> of the truth of this matter before the Inquiſitors of that <hi>Court,</hi> they preſently drew up a Charge of <hi>Murther</hi> againſt the <hi>Grand Caſhier,</hi> who, 'tis expected (it being his own deſire) will very ſuddenly be tried by
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95381:151"/>
his <hi>Peers</hi> upon it, although at the ſame time he ſtands impeached in the <hi>Grand Senate,</hi> for Crimes, according to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonian Laws,</hi> of an higher nature.</p>
               <p>But now to blind this Diſcovery, another piece of <hi>Villany</hi> is contrived to <hi>ſham off</hi> the credit of it, by hiring one <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> a <hi>Petropolitan Boglander</hi> to give out a Report that Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was not murthered (contrary to what the World had hitherto believed) by any but himſelf, that he had hanged himſelf with his <hi>own hands,</hi> but that to ſave his Eſtate (which according to the <hi>Albonia</hi>) Laws in ſuch caſes is forfeited) Sir <hi>Edmonds</hi> Brothers had procured him to run him through with his own Sword, and leave him in ſuch manner as is at firſt mentioned. This Tale he muſt needs tell firſt to the <hi>Grand Caſhier</hi> himſelf, who gets the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of the <hi>Royal Tower</hi> to have the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; who thereupon ſends him to the <hi>Royal Council</hi> to be examined about it: Before them, at firſt he very ſtubbornly perſiſts in affirming the Reports. But while he was in Cuſtody, having leave gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to write a Letter to one of the <hi>Royal Secretaries,</hi> he together with that, ſlips a Letter into the <hi>Meſſengers</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:95381:152"/>
hands directed to the <hi>Petropolitan Midwife</hi> (the famous Inſtrument of of theſe Deſigns) acquainting her with what he had done, and deſiring to receive new inſtructions from her. This Letter was by the honeſt Meſſenger conveyed to the <hi>Royal Council,</hi> who upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, charging him with it, he preſently owned it; and withall made a free, and (if I may call it ſo) ingenious <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of the whole <hi>Intrigue,</hi> and how he was hired, and by whom, to carry on this <hi>ſham</hi> and Villainous Deſign.</p>
               <p>I was now (methoughts) diverting my ſelf in a ſolitary place not far from the City, muſing upon theſe matters, when it came into my mind, that as the finding out this execrable <hi>Murther</hi> was the very <hi>Ground-work</hi> of our <hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> and belief of the <hi>Plot;</hi> ſo now we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the <hi>Policy</hi> of the <hi>Petropolitans,</hi> after ſo many <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> made, and their <hi>Shams</hi> to overthrow them defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they ſhould go about to weaken thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whilſt I continued in this <hi>Thinking Fit,</hi> I was on the ſuddain diverted by the approach of an <hi>Apparition</hi> towards me; it was different from thoſe infernal ones that I had hitherto been converſant with, being incircled with a <hi>Glory</hi> that ſpread it ſelf round about like the Rayes of the Sun, and the <hi>Luſter</hi> thereof rendred its <hi>Form</hi> (which was that of a comely tall perſon) not onely awful but amiable; its looks were <hi>Angel-like,</hi> full of Gaiety and Sweetneſs: but withal I perceived a <hi>Sword</hi> run through his body. He glided towards me with a leiſurely motion, and upon a convenient approach ſtood ſtill, and in a ſweet and delightful air (far more tunable than any mortal breath can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs) he ſpake to me in theſe Diſticks.</p>
